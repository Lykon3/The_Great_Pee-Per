# Figure Preparation Quick Guide for PTFFG Paper

This guide will help you efficiently prepare high-quality figures for your PTFFG paper submission to arXiv and Physical Review D.

## Essential Requirements

### Resolution & Format
- **Resolution**: Minimum 300 dpi (600 dpi preferred for line art)
- **Preferred formats**: 
  - PDF (vector format, preferred for arXiv and PRD)
  - EPS (alternative vector format)
  - PNG (raster format, ensure high resolution)
- **Size**: Width should match column width (3.4 inches for single column, 7 inches for double column)

### Naming Convention
- Use exact filenames referenced in your LaTeX file: `figure1.pdf`, `figure2.pdf`, etc.
- Do not use spaces or special characters in filenames

## Figure-Specific Guidelines

### Figure 1: Lensing Distortion Maps
- **Content**: Side-by-side comparison of PTFFG vs GR distortion maps
- **Format**: 
  - Two panels labeled (a) and (b)
  - Consistent colorbar for both panels
  - Color scheme: "viridis" or "plasma" colormap (readable in grayscale)
- **Text elements**: 
  - Label panels as "PTFFG" and "GR"
  - Include colorbar with "Displacement Magnitude" label
  - Use sans-serif font (Arial or Helvetica) for all text, 9pt minimum

### Figure 2: Deflection Angle Distribution
- **Content**: Histograms of deflection angles
- **Format**:
  - Blue line/bars for PTFFG
  - Green line/bars for GR
  - Include legend
- **Text elements**:
  - X-axis: "Deflection Angle (degrees)"
  - Y-axis: "Frequency"
  - Include standard deviation values in the plot

### Figure 3: Power Spectrum Comparison
- **Content**: Log-log plot of power spectra
- **Format**:
  - Blue points and fitted line for PTFFG
  - Green points and fitted line for GR
  - Grid lines (light gray) for readability
- **Text elements**:
  - X-axis: "Spatial Frequency (k)"
  - Y-axis: "Power Spectrum P(k)"
  - Annotate fitted slopes: α_PTFFG = -1.87 ± 0.12, α_GR = -0.61 ± 0.09

### Figure 4: Scale-Dependent Analysis
- **Content**: Three panels showing power spectra at different k-ranges
- **Format**:
  - Three panels labeled (a), (b), and (c)
  - Consistent formatting across all panels
  - Same color scheme as Figure 3
- **Text elements**:
  - Label each panel: "Large scales", "Intermediate scales", "Small scales"
  - Include fitted slopes for each scale range

### Figure 5: Chromatic Effects
- **Content**: Three-panel figure showing frequency-dependent lensing
- **Format**:
  - Panel (a): Full ray paths with color gradient by frequency
  - Panel (b): Zoomed view of separation region
  - Panel (c): Plot of separation vs. frequency shift
- **Text elements**:
  - Include maximum separation value
  - Clear legend indicating frequency bands

### Figure 6: Polarization Rotation
- **Content**: Three-panel figure showing polarization effects
- **Format**:
  - Panel (a): Spatial map of rotation angles
  - Panel (b): Correlation plot
  - Panel (c): Vector field overlay on fractal dimension map
- **Text elements**:
  - Include correlation coefficient
  - Colorbar for rotation magnitude

## Technical Tips

### Using Matplotlib (Python)
```python
# High-quality figure setup
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl

# Set DPI and figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(7, 5), dpi=600)

# Better fonts
plt.rcParams.update({
    'font.family': 'sans-serif',
    'font.sans-serif': ['Arial'],
    'font.size': 10,
    'mathtext.fontset': 'stix'
})

# Save as PDF (vector format)
plt.savefig('figure1.pdf', format='pdf', bbox_inches='tight', dpi=600)

# Alternative: save as high-res PNG
plt.savefig('figure1.png', format='png', bbox_inches='tight', dpi=600)
```

### Using MATLAB
```matlab
% High-quality figure setup
fig = figure('Position', [0 0 700 500]);

% Set font properties
set(gca, 'FontName', 'Arial', 'FontSize', 10);

% Export as PDF
exportgraphics(fig, 'figure1.pdf', 'Resolution', 600);

% Alternative: save as high-res PNG
exportgraphics(fig, 'figure1.png', 'Resolution', 600);
```

## Final Checklist

- [ ] All figures match LaTeX references exactly (`figure1.pdf` through `figure6.pdf`)
- [ ] All text in figures is legible (minimum 9pt font size when printed)
- [ ] Color schemes are colorblind-friendly and grayscale-compatible
- [ ] All panels are labeled consistently ((a), (b), (c), etc.)
- [ ] Physical units included on all relevant axes
- [ ] Error bars or uncertainties shown where applicable
- [ ] Resolution is minimum 300 dpi for all figures
- [ ] File sizes are reasonable (under 5MB per figure for arXiv submission)

## PRD-Specific Requirements

Physical Review D has specific figure guidelines:
- Maximum figure width: 3.4 inches (single column) or 7 inches (double column)
- Line weights: minimum 0.5 pt (thin lines), 1.5 pt (thick lines)
- Labels must be proportional to figure size (no tiny text)
- Color figures should be readable when printed in grayscale

## Final Export

Before final submission, open each PDF figure to verify:
- All elements are visible
- Text is not cut off or pixelated
- Colors render correctly
- File size is reasonable

This guide will help ensure your figures meet all technical requirements while effectively communicating your groundbreaking PTFFG results.
