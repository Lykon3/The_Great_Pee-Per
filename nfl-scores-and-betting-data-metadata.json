Dataset was created from a variety of sources including games and scores from a variety of public websites such as ESPN, NFL.com, and Pro Football Reference. Weather information is from NOAA data with NFLweather.com a good cross reference. Betting data was used from http://www.repole.com/sun4cast/data.html for 1978-2013 seasons. Pro-football-reference.com data was then cross referenced for betting lines and odds as well as weather data. From 2013 on betting data reflects lines available at sportsline.com and aussportsbetting.com.\n\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nHelpful sites with interest in football and sports betting include:\n\nhttps://github.com/fivethirtyeight/nfl-elo-game\n\nhttp://www.repole.com/sun4cast/data.html\n\nhttps://www.pro-football-reference.com/\n\nhttp://www.espn.com/nfl/\n\nhttp://www.nflweather.com/\n\nhttps://github.com/ThompsonJamesBliss/WeatherData\n\nhttps://github.com/jp-wright/nfl_betting_market_analysis\n\nhttp://www.aussportsbetting.com/data/historical-nfl-results-and-odds-data/\n\nhttps://github.com/Nolanole/NFL-Weather-Project\n\n### Inspiration\n\nCan you build a predictive model to better predict NFL game outcomes and identify successful betting strategies?"}
