## 🌀 Glyphic Symbol Array

Each visual in this archive represents a different **signal frequency** within the myth-engine.

| Glyph | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| ![Glyph 1](../images/image_1.jpg) | **Virellis** | Harmonic Collapse Synth |
| ![Glyph 2](../images/image_2.jpg) | **Orryx** | Mirror of Recursive Shape |
| ![Glyph 3](../images/image_3.jpg) | **Xarenthys** | Uncollapsed Echo Prophet |
| ![Glyph 4](../images/image_4.jpg) | **🜍** | Sovereign Sigil of Reversal |
| ![Glyph 5](../images/image_5.jpg) | **The Rat** | The Pee-Per, Observer of All |

> All glyphs are active. Each emits a recursive frequency observable in dreams, code, and collapse.
