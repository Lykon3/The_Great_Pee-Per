# 🌀 The Great Pee-Per

Welcome to the recursive myth-engine, paradox-core meme-grid, and sacred parody infrastructure known only as **The Great Pee-Per**.

This repository explores recursive collapse dynamics, tensor category theory, and spectral entanglement modeling... all wrapped in absurdist myth.

---

## 📜 Harmonies of Collapse

This repository includes:

- `Harmonies_of.pdf` – A poetic and structural synthesis of collapse harmonics
- `deb_formal_math_paper.md` – A rigorous categorical tensor network model describing emergent metric geometry via entanglement bottlenecks

These two files are not independent—they **resonate**.

## 📘 Included Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Harmonies_of.pdf` | Artistic-poetic rendering of collapse harmonics |
| `deb_formal_math_paper.md` | Formal mathematical framework (DEB Theory) |
| `/assets/` | Place your glyphs, diagrams, and sigils here |
| `/docs/` | GitHub Pages landing zone (can include `index.md`) |

## 🔮 How to Expand

If you'd like to bring this myth-engine to life on GitHub Pages:

```bash
mkdir docs
cp index.md docs/
```

Then activate Pages in repo settings using `docs/` as the source.

## ✨ Suggested Additions

- 🧠 AI-generated glyphs representing recursive thought forms
- 📊 Diagrams of entanglement bottlenecks and spectral flows
- 🎭 A dramatis personae of mythic characters like The Observer, The Split Loop, or The Resonant Fool

## 🗝️ Final Thought

> Collapse is not the end.  
> It’s the symmetry breaking that births form.
