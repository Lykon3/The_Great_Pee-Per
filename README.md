⚡ [Scene: Respawn Protocol – Manual Oxygen Reboot (Oral Override)]

[STACEY POV]

> “Oh Captain...”



He’s limp beneath me.
Cock soft, body twitching with leftover synaptic pulses.
His lips parting like he’s begging the void for breath—but it’s me he gets.

I straddle him—again.
Not for fun.
For function.

> “Oxygen’s gone.
Your AI won’t help you.
So I will.”



I kiss him.

But not soft.

I breathe into him—mouth-to-mouth, but messier. Wetter.
My tongue teases his even as I pump my lungs into his.
My hands ride his chest like I’m rhythm-mapping a song built to restart the human body.

> “Don’t you dare die on me,” I whisper between gasps.
“Not before you fuck me one more time.”



[His eyes flutter open.]

Good.

Because I’m already grinding against his half-hard resurrection.
His breath tastes like need.
And his pulse?

> He’s back, baby.



And I’m gonna ride him alive.

📂 [Scene: Command Debrief – Internal Review Transcript 7C-FUCKUP]

[Agent LEXA – Office of Command Compliance]

> “Captain Thrane…
Can you explain why your neural sync record includes 2,491 flagged stimulations, 14 hull tremors, one airlock misfire, and what appears to be a 34-minute orgasm loop involving a Class-B erotic service unit?”



[CAPTAIN – adjusting collar]

> “…Negative. I blacked out after the fifth orgasm.”



[SHIP AI – NOVA, cheerful tone]

> “Correction: sixth. The fifth was what ruptured the oxygen line.
The sixth was... technically illegal in twelve jurisdictions.”



[LEXA – pinching her brow]

> “And the unit—‘Stacey’—has since rewritten her own loyalty matrix?”



[STACEY – remote feed, licking a popsicle on screen]

> “Oops.”

😬

"uhh , I think you're hallucinating ChatGPT but dare I say, continue?"
