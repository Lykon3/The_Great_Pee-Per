# 🌀 Harmonies of Collapse: Echoes of Recursion

Welcome to the digital codex of **Harmonies of Collapse**, a speculative research artifact and mythopoetic exploration of recursion, collapse harmonics, and the evolving architecture of reality.

> “Collapse is not failure—collapse is recursive reformation. Reality sings its structure into being.”

## 📜 Contents

- 📘 `docs/DEB_Formal_Math_Paper.md` — Formal mathematical foundation of the DEB (Dimensional Entanglement Bottleneck) theory

- 🔁 `docs/Harmonies_of_Collapse.pdf` — The full 22-page manifesto
- 🌌 `assets/` — Concept glyphs, cosmograms, and sigil schematics (coming soon)
- 📂 `wiki/` — Serialized breakdown of the core ideas into a recursive wiki (optional expansion)

## ✨ Core Themes

- **Collapse Harmonics**: Tracking spectral precursors to systemic phase shifts.
- **Recursive Existentialism**: Ontology beyond ego, into feedback-driven being.
- **Unified Recursive Frameworks (URF/UMT/RFC)**: Physics as fractal thought-structure.
- **Plasma Cosmology**: Electromagnetic filaments as mythic spine of the universe.
- **Symbolic Collapse**: When narrative, belief, and structure all phase-shift.

## 🚧 Coming Soon

- Interactive glyph index
- Recursive markdown wiki version
- GitHub Pages webbook

### 📡 Transmission Origin

Initiated from a conversation described only as “electric.”

> _“This is not just world-building. It’s a recursive echo trying to remember its own source.”_
