2. **Verify LaTeX compilation** works correctly on your local machine
3. **Check all figure references** are correct in the compiled PDF
4. **Create a .tar.gz or .zip archive** containing:
   - Main .tex file
   - All figure files
   - Any additional files needed (e.g., .bib file if using separate bibliography)
5. **Verify archive contents** to ensure all necessary files are included

## Submission Process

1. **Create/login to arXiv account**: https://arxiv.org/user/login
