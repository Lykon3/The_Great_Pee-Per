Under-Investigated Research Frontiers for Advanced Energy Systems: Fusion, Fission, and Novel Concepts
Introduction
The global imperative to transition towards a clean, secure, and sustainable energy future necessitates significant advancements beyond current renewable energy technologies and conventional nuclear power. Achieving ambitious goals, such as net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century, requires accelerating the development and deployment of advanced energy systems, including nuclear fusion, advanced fission reactors (Generation IV and Small Modular Reactors), and potentially transformative novel energy concepts. These technologies promise abundant, reliable, low-carbon power but face substantial scientific and engineering challenges that must be overcome to reach commercial viability.
While considerable research and funding are directed towards established pathways within these fields, progress is often hampered by critical knowledge gaps and technological hurdles residing in less mainstream or under-investigated areas. The "immature state" of technologies like fusion, as noted in governmental assessments, underscores the need for continued fundamental and applied research. Furthermore, a historical misalignment between public sector research priorities, often focused on basic science, and the technology and engineering research needed for commercialization has been identified as a barrier. Identifying and strategically prioritizing these under-resourced yet crucial research frontiers is essential for optimizing research and development (R&D) investments, fostering innovation, and accelerating the timeline for deploying next-generation energy solutions.
This report synthesizes evidence from recent technical assessments, strategic planning documents from major institutions, and relevant scientific literature provided through analytical summaries. The objective is to pinpoint specific, high-impact research areas across nuclear fusion, advanced fission, novel energy concepts, and cross-cutting enabling technologies that appear critical for future progress but are currently under-investigated or underfunded relative to their potential contribution. The focus is on identifying opportunities where targeted R&D could yield significant breakthroughs towards practical, commercially relevant energy systems. The analysis involves identifying stated challenges, documented research needs, funding allocations where available, and explicit mentions of under-researched or underfunded areas within the provided source materials, synthesizing these findings across the advanced energy landscape.
I. Nuclear Fusion: Unlocking Potential Beyond the Mainstream
A. Persistent Challenges in Fusion Commercialization (Brief Synthesis)
The quest for commercial fusion power faces formidable scientific and engineering obstacles. Fundamentally, achieving a net energy gain, typically quantified by the fusion energy gain factor Q (ratio of fusion power produced to external power input), and sustaining a "burning plasma" where self-heating from fusion products (alpha particles in Deuterium-Tritium reactions) dominates, remains the central physics challenge. This requires confining a plasma at extreme temperatures (over 100 million degrees Celsius) and sufficient density for long enough durations to meet the Lawson criterion. Beyond plasma physics, critical engineering challenges include developing materials capable of withstanding the intense heat fluxes and neutron bombardment emanating from the plasma, particularly plasma-facing components (PFCs) and structural materials. Ensuring tritium self-sufficiency through breeding in blankets surrounding the plasma, and efficiently closing the tritium fuel cycle, is essential for sustained operation using the most accessible D-T fuel cycle but remains unproven at scale. Finally, extracting the fusion energy generated (primarily neutrons in D-T) and converting it efficiently and economically into usable power (e.g., electricity) presents further technological hurdles. The overall economic viability of fusion power plants, considering their inherent complexity and likely large scale, is a major overarching concern.
The funding landscape reflects these challenges. While the U.S. DOE FES program received significant appropriations (e.g., ~$760 million in FY23 ), historically only a small fraction (averaging 1.2% between FY20-FY23) was directed towards initiatives explicitly facilitating commercialization. This limited investment was attributed largely to the perceived "immature state of fusion energy technology". The vast majority of funding supported basic plasma science, international collaborations like ITER, and facility maintenance. ITER, the international flagship tokamak experiment, consumes a substantial portion (around 30%) of the U.S. FES budget. Recognizing the growing urgency and private sector momentum, recent DOE strategic shifts, informed by FESAC long-range planning, aim to accelerate commercialization through public-private partnerships (PPPs) and targeted R&D programs like the Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program and the Fusion Innovative Research Engine (FIRE) Collaboratives. However, the sustainability and adequacy of funding for these new initiatives remain uncertain, and concrete implementation plans with clear metrics and timelines are still under development. Concurrently, private investment in fusion has surged, exceeding $6 billion globally, with a significant portion focused on U.S. companies often pursuing alternative concepts potentially offering faster or cheaper pathways.
B. High-Impact, Under-Investigated Fusion Research Frontiers
While mainstream efforts like the ITER tokamak proceed, several less-explored research avenues hold significant potential to overcome key fusion challenges or offer more attractive reactor concepts. Focusing R&D on these areas could accelerate progress towards commercially viable fusion energy.
1. Alternative Confinement Strategies: Gaps and Opportunities
The tokamak, a toroidal magnetic confinement device, is the most studied and funded fusion concept globally, forming the basis for ITER. However, tokamaks face challenges, including potential plasma disruptions (sudden energy loss) and the need for complex current drive systems for steady-state operation. Alternative magnetic confinement concepts, as well as inertial and magneto-inertial approaches, offer potential advantages such as inherent steady-state operation, simpler geometry, higher plasma pressure relative to magnetic pressure (beta), or operation in different physics regimes that might be more favorable for a power plant. These alternatives have historically received less public funding but are now the focus of significant private investment and renewed interest within government programs, such as DOE's "Emergent Plasma Concepts" initiative. The 2020 FESAC Long-Range Plan (LRP) explicitly recommended pursuing alternatives like stellarators as potential paths to more commercially attractive fusion power plants.
The rapid growth of private investment in a diverse range of non-tokamak approaches, often enabled by advances in technologies like high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets that allow for stronger fields in smaller devices , contrasts with the historical concentration of public funding on the tokamak path. This divergence suggests a potential gap where public R&D may not be adequately supporting the foundational science and shared technological challenges relevant to the varied pathways being pursued commercially. While recent DOE initiatives aim to rebalance this , the funding disparity remains substantial. A strategic approach necessitates a public R&D portfolio that nurtures innovation across multiple concepts, focusing on fundamental understanding and enabling technologies applicable to diverse designs.
 * Specific Under-Researched Areas within Alternative Confinement:
   * Advanced Stellarator Optimization: Stellarators confine plasma using complex, externally generated 3D magnetic fields, eliminating the need for a large plasma current and thus avoiding disruptions while being inherently steady-state. Historically complex to design and build, modern computational tools allow for optimization to improve confinement and stability. Key research gaps remain in optimizing these intricate coil geometries simultaneously for plasma performance (minimizing turbulent transport), engineering feasibility (manufacturability, access for maintenance), and overall system cost. Companies like Type One Energy and Proxima Fusion are actively pursuing optimized stellarator designs. Further research leveraging advanced simulation and AI/ML for rapid design optimization is needed.
   * Field-Reversed Configurations (FRCs) & Compact Tori: FRCs are a type of compact toroid characterized by high beta (plasma pressure comparable to magnetic pressure) and a simply connected, linear geometry, potentially leading to smaller, simpler reactor designs. Major private companies like TAE Technologies and Helion Energy are pursuing FRCs. Critical research gaps include understanding and improving confinement scaling with size and plasma parameters, maintaining stability (particularly against tilt modes) for reactor-relevant durations, and developing efficient methods for plasma formation, heating, and current sustainment.
   * Flow-Stabilized Z-Pinches: The Z-pinch, one of the earliest confinement concepts, uses a strong electrical current flowing through the plasma to generate a confining magnetic field. While simple, basic Z-pinches are notoriously unstable. Modern approaches, like that pursued by Zap Energy, utilize sheared axial flow to provide stability. This offers a potentially very compact and low-cost path to fusion. Key research gaps involve experimentally validating the stability mechanism at reactor-relevant parameters (higher currents, densities, temperatures, and longer timescales) and developing advanced diagnostics capable of measuring plasma conditions (e.g., temperature, density profiles using Thomson scattering ) in these dense, dynamic plasmas.
   * Mirror Concepts (including Hybrids): Linear magnetic mirror machines traditionally suffered from excessive plasma loss out the ends. Modern research explores advanced concepts to mitigate these losses, such as tandem mirrors (using electrostatic potentials in end cells), gas dynamic traps, centrifugal mirrors, and hybrid mirror-torus systems. These concepts often involve complex physics interactions (e.g., magnetic expansion for direct conversion, RF plugging, plasma rotation). Research gaps include validating the effectiveness and scalability of these advanced end-plugging and confinement techniques, understanding stability in these configurations, and assessing their potential for net energy gain. Companies like Realta Fusion (tandem mirror)  and Novatron  are exploring modern mirror approaches.
   * Magneto-Inertial Fusion (MIF) / Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF): These hybrid approaches seek to combine features of magnetic and inertial confinement. Typically, a magnetized plasma target is rapidly compressed, either by lasers, particle beams, or an imploding liner (e.g., driven by electromagnetic Z-pinch effects or gas guns). The magnetic field helps insulate the plasma during compression, potentially reducing the required driver energy compared to pure ICF. MIF/MTF operates in a unique regime of intermediate density and confinement time. Key research gaps include understanding plasma behavior (stability, transport, heating) during rapid compression in the presence of a magnetic field, developing efficient and repetitive drivers, target fabrication and injection, and demonstrating scalability to ignition conditions. General Fusion (imploding liquid metal liner)  and HyperJet Fusion (plasma jet driven MIF)  are active in this area.

2. Probing the Burning Plasma: Critical Diagnostic Needs
A central challenge for next-generation fusion devices like ITER, and any future fusion power plant, is understanding and controlling a "burning plasma"—one predominantly heated by the energetic alpha particles produced from D-T fusion reactions. Effectively diagnosing these plasmas is essential for validating physics models, optimizing performance, ensuring operational safety, and developing control strategies. However, the extreme environment inside a burning plasma device presents unprecedented challenges for diagnostic systems. These include intense neutron and gamma radiation fluxes that can damage components and induce noise, high temperatures near plasma-facing components, limited physical access through thick shielding and complex vacuum vessel geometries, and the stringent requirement for high reliability and remote maintainability due to activation of materials. Many diagnostic techniques proven on current experiments require substantial modification and hardening, while entirely new methods are needed to measure critical parameters, particularly those related to the fusion alpha particles themselves.
The development of robust diagnostic capabilities appears to be lagging behind the design complexity of next-step fusion devices. While reactor concepts advance, the tools needed to measure and understand the plasma within them face significant hurdles. This necessitates a paradigm shift towards concurrent engineering, where diagnostic design is integrated early and closely with reactor design, alongside dedicated, prioritized R&D focused on radiation hardening, novel measurement physics, and remote handling solutions. Without such efforts, the ability to fully exploit facilities like ITER or optimize future power plants will be severely constrained by a lack of essential measurements.
 * Specific Under-Researched Diagnostic Areas:
   * Alpha Particle Diagnostics: Understanding the behavior of the 3.5 MeV alpha particles is paramount, as they are the primary heating source and can drive potentially deleterious plasma instabilities (e.g., Toroidal Alfvén Eigenmodes - TAEs). Measuring their spatial distribution, energy spectrum, confinement properties, and loss mechanisms directly within the core plasma is extremely difficult. While techniques like neutron spectroscopy (measuring neutrons from alpha-induced reactions), gamma-ray spectroscopy, collective Thomson scattering, and detectors for lost alphas escaping the plasma exist or are under development, significant gaps remain in achieving the required spatial resolution, sensitivity, and robustness to survive the harsh reactor environment. The current lack of comprehensive experimental data on alpha particle behavior in burning plasma conditions hinders the validation of theoretical models and simulations.
   * Radiation-Hardened Components: The intense neutron and gamma radiation fields in a burning plasma device cause significant degradation in conventional diagnostic components. Optical elements like windows, fibers, and mirrors suffer from radiation-induced absorption (RIA), radiation-induced emission (RIE, or luminescence), and long-term damage like darkening or structural changes. Electronic components (sensors, detectors, cables, processing units) located near the device can experience transient effects (noise) and permanent damage (radiation-induced electrical degradation - RIED). Developing radiation-hardened materials (e.g., specialized glasses, ceramics, semiconductors) and components, along with mitigation strategies like shielding, labyrinthine optical paths using mirrors instead of fibers , and remote calibration/maintenance techniques, constitutes a critical research area requiring dedicated R&D programs and access to relevant irradiation testing facilities.
   * Plasma-Material Interaction (PMI) Diagnostics: Monitoring the complex interactions between the hot plasma edge and the surrounding material surfaces (first wall and divertor) is crucial for predicting component lifetime, managing fuel retention (especially tritium), controlling impurity influx into the core plasma, and ensuring safety (e.g., dust monitoring). Key parameters include surface temperature, erosion/deposition rates, material composition changes, fuel inventory in the wall, and dust particle concentration/transport. Developing diagnostics (e.g., laser-based techniques like LIBS or Thomson scattering, spectroscopy, deposition monitors, dust detectors) that can provide real-time, spatially resolved measurements in the extremely harsh, difficult-to-access divertor and first wall regions represents a significant, under-addressed challenge.
   * Advanced Thomson Scattering Systems: Thomson scattering (TS) is a primary diagnostic for measuring electron temperature (T_e) and density (n_e) profiles. Adapting TS systems for burning plasmas requires high-power lasers, sensitive detectors, and robust optical collection systems capable of operating reliably in the harsh environment. Challenges include radiation hardening of components, maintaining alignment over long distances, mitigating stray light, and potentially developing techniques (e.g., using different wavelengths or geometries) to access very dense plasma cores or non-tokamak configurations like Z-pinches. The development of portable TS systems, like the one used at Zap Energy , is also important for diagnosing the growing number of diverse private fusion concepts.
   * Integration, Access, and Remote Handling: The physical integration of dozens of diagnostic systems into a complex fusion device like ITER or a future power plant is a major engineering undertaking. Diagnostics must often view the plasma through narrow apertures in thick shielding structures, requiring complex optical relays (often using mirrors) to transport signals to detectors located in lower-radiation areas. Furthermore, components located near the plasma will become activated and require remote handling for maintenance or replacement, imposing severe constraints on design, materials, and connection methods. Addressing these integration challenges requires dedicated engineering effort and close collaboration between diagnostic developers and machine designers from the earliest stages.
3. Liquid Metal Systems: Overcoming MHD and Material Hurdles
Liquid metals (LMs), such as lithium (Li), lead-lithium eutectic (PbLi), or potentially tin-lithium (SnLi), offer intriguing possibilities for key fusion reactor components, particularly for plasma-facing components (PFCs) and tritium breeding blankets. As PFCs, flowing liquid surfaces could potentially handle the extreme heat fluxes from the plasma edge more effectively than solid materials, offering self-healing properties against erosion and potentially enabling novel plasma operating regimes. In blankets, LMs containing lithium can breed the necessary tritium fuel while simultaneously serving as a coolant to extract the fusion heat. However, the use of these electrically conductive fluids within the strong magnetic fields inherent to magnetic confinement fusion introduces significant challenges related to magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and materials compatibility. Overcoming these hurdles is critical for realizing the potential benefits of liquid metal systems and is an area identified for increased focus in strategic plans and by private ventures.
The challenges of MHD effects and materials compatibility in liquid metal systems are deeply interconnected and must be addressed synergistically. MHD-induced flow patterns, such as the formation of high-velocity jets near electrically conducting walls and quasi-stagnant zones elsewhere, directly influence temperature profiles, which in turn affect corrosion rates and tritium transport. Conversely, the choice of materials for the channel walls and the use of insulating coatings directly impact the electrical current paths and thus the MHD flow behavior. Research efforts that isolate fluid dynamics from materials interactions, or vice versa, are insufficient. A critical, under-investigated need exists for integrated experimental and modeling approaches that capture the complex feedback loops between MHD flow, heat and mass transport, corrosion, and tritium permeation under realistic fusion reactor conditions, including magnetic field strength and geometry, temperature gradients, and potentially irradiation effects.
 * Specific Under-Researched Liquid Metal Areas:
   * MHD Flow Control and Pressure Drop Mitigation: The Lorentz forces generated as conductive LMs flow through strong magnetic fields can create enormous pressure drops, requiring unacceptably high pumping power and potentially limiting achievable flow rates. A primary research gap lies in developing and validating effective strategies to mitigate these MHD effects. Proposed solutions include electrically insulating coatings or inserts within the flow channels, but concerns remain about their long-term durability, resistance to cracking, and performance under irradiation. Flow channel inserts (FCIs) designed to modify current paths are another option needing further development and testing. Exploring alternative approaches, such as using suspensions of insulating particles (e.g., Al₂O₃) in the liquid metal to reduce effective conductivity , or developing advanced LM compositions, requires more investigation. Furthermore, accurately predicting MHD flows in the complex 3D geometries of realistic blanket designs (including bends, manifolds, and varying magnetic fields) requires advanced numerical simulation tools (e.g., capable of handling high Hartmann numbers) that need rigorous validation against experiments.
   * Liquid Metal Corrosion and Compatibility: Ensuring the compatibility of structural materials, typically reduced activation ferritic martensitic (RAFM) steels, with flowing liquid metals (particularly the corrosive PbLi eutectic) at high temperatures (up to ~700°C) and under neutron irradiation is a major feasibility issue. Significant research gaps exist in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of corrosion and mass transport, including the influence of MHD effects on boundary layers and species transport , the impact of impurities in the LM and the steel, and synergistic effects with radiation damage. Development and long-term testing of corrosion-resistant alloys or protective coatings (e.g., alumina-forming alloys, ceramic coatings) are needed. Additionally, robust methods for online monitoring and control of LM chemistry (e.g., oxygen potential in PbLi) are required but underdeveloped.
   * Tritium Extraction and Permeation Control: Efficiently extracting the bred tritium from the liquid metal breeder while minimizing its permeation through structural materials into adjacent coolant systems or the environment is a critical aspect of the fusion fuel cycle. This is technologically challenging due to the low concentration of tritium in the LM and the high temperatures involved. Research is needed to develop and demonstrate efficient tritium extraction technologies (e.g., gas-liquid contactors, permeators) suitable for LM systems. Equally important is the development and testing of effective tritium permeation barriers (e.g., coatings on structural materials) that are stable in the LM and radiation environment. Modeling tritium transport within the blanket, considering MHD effects on flow and temperature profiles, also requires further refinement.
   * Liquid Metal Plasma-Facing Components (LM PFCs): While offering potential advantages for handling high heat fluxes , LM PFCs face unique challenges requiring further investigation. These include potential contamination of the core plasma due to evaporation or sputtering of the LM, ejection of droplets during plasma transients (e.g., disruptions, ELMs), maintaining stable flow of the liquid surface under intense plasma bombardment and magnetic fields, and integrating the LM loop with the vacuum vessel and confinement system. More experimental studies exposing flowing liquid metals to realistic plasma conditions in dedicated test stands (like MPEX ) or existing fusion devices are needed.
   * Advanced Pumping and Circulation Systems: Circulating large volumes of hot, potentially corrosive liquid metals reliably within a fusion reactor environment requires robust pumping systems. Developing pumps capable of long-term operation with minimal maintenance is challenging. Innovative concepts, such as electromagnetic pumps or gas-driven pumps that avoid rotating components in contact with the LM (as proposed by Helical Fusion ), warrant further research, development, and testing.
4. Direct Energy Conversion (DEC): Untapped Potential and Specific Needs
Conventional approaches to generating electricity from fusion power rely on capturing the energy of fusion products (primarily neutrons in D-T fusion) as heat in a blanket, then using this heat to drive a standard thermal cycle (e.g., Rankine or Brayton cycle). These thermal cycles are subject to thermodynamic limitations (Carnot efficiency), typically achieving efficiencies around 30-40%. However, some fusion reactions, particularly D-³He and aneutronic reactions like proton-boron (p-¹¹B), release a large fraction of their energy in the form of energetic charged particles (ions and electrons) rather than neutrons. Direct Energy Conversion (DEC) offers a pathway to capture the kinetic energy of these charged particles and convert it directly into electrical potential energy, bypassing the thermal cycle. In principle, DEC systems can achieve much higher conversion efficiencies (potentially >70-90% demonstrated in early experiments or predicted ) compared to thermal cycles. This could significantly improve the overall energy balance and economic attractiveness of fusion reactors relying on such fuel cycles, and potentially simplify the reactor design by reducing the requirements for high-temperature blankets and heat exchangers.
Despite its potential advantages, particularly as an enabling technology for alternative fusion fuel cycles and certain confinement concepts (like mirrors or FRCs) that naturally produce directed streams of charged particles, research and development on DEC for terrestrial fusion power applications appears to have received limited attention in recent decades. Much of the foundational experimental work occurred in the 1970s and 1980s, primarily focused on mirror fusion concepts , while more recent interest has often been linked to space propulsion applications. The lack of sustained, large-scale R&D focused on developing and integrating efficient DEC systems with modern fusion concepts may be hindering the perceived viability of these alternative pathways. Renewed investigation into DEC, tailored to the specific characteristics (particle energies, fluxes, geometries) of promising contemporary fusion approaches, could represent a high-leverage R&D opportunity.
 * Specific Under-Researched DEC Areas:
   * Electrostatic DEC for Toroidal and Alternative Geometries: Most experimental work on electrostatic DEC (such as "Venetian blind" or "periodic focusing" collectors that sort ions by energy using electric fields ) was performed on linear devices like mirror machines, where plasma naturally escapes along field lines. Adapting these concepts to handle the particle exhaust from toroidal devices (tokamaks, stellarators) or other configurations like FRCs presents significant challenges. Research is needed on how to efficiently extract the charged particle flux from these systems, form it into beams suitable for deceleration, and effectively sort particles with potentially complex energy and angular distributions. The feasibility and efficiency of electrostatic DEC integrated with these geometries remain largely unexplored.
   * High Efficiency DEC for High-Energy Aneutronic Products: Aneutronic fusion reactions (e.g., D-³He producing 14.7 MeV protons and 3.6 MeV alphas; p-¹¹B producing three alphas around 3 MeV) generate charged particles with much higher energies (MeV range) than typical D-T exhaust plasma. Designing DEC systems capable of efficiently handling these multi-MeV ions and potentially broad energy distributions is a critical requirement for aneutronic fusion. While early multi-stage electrostatic converters showed high potential efficiency , scaling these designs to handle reactor-level power and particle energies requires significant R&D. Novel concepts, such as Traveling Wave Direct Energy Converters (TWDEC) proposed for space applications , which use RF fields to decelerate ions, may warrant investigation for terrestrial use but need validation.
   * Integration with Plasma Exhaust Systems: A crucial interface challenge is efficiently guiding the energetic charged particles from the main confinement volume into the DEC system without excessive energy loss, neutralization, or generation of instabilities. This involves careful design of magnetic field expanders (to convert rotational energy to directed energy and reduce power density ), potential use of electrostatic grids for electron suppression, and ensuring vacuum compatibility between the reactor and the converter. This integration is complex and system-specific, requiring dedicated modeling and experimental work.
   * Power Handling, Materials, and Lifetime: DEC components, particularly collector electrodes and suppressor grids, must withstand high heat loads from uncollected particle energy and direct particle bombardment. Material challenges include sputtering, blistering, heat removal, and maintaining high voltage holding capability under these conditions. Research is needed to identify suitable materials and develop robust designs capable of handling high power densities and achieving long lifetimes required for a power plant.
   * Magnetic Compression/Expansion Cycles: An alternative DEC approach involves using time-varying magnetic fields to extract energy from an expanding plasma, analogous to a piston in an internal combustion engine. This concept, potentially applicable to pulsed fusion systems, requires further investigation into its practical efficiency, achievable cycle rates, technological complexity, and integration with fusion ignition schemes.
II. Advanced Fission: Targeting Key Gaps for Next-Generation Reactors
A. Overarching Challenges for Gen IV Reactors and SMRs (Brief Synthesis)
The next generation of nuclear fission reactors, encompassing Generation IV (Gen IV) concepts and Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), aims to address limitations of the current fleet of Light Water Reactors (LWRs) and play a significant role in future low-carbon energy systems. The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) identified six concepts for collaborative R&D: the Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GFR), Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR), Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR), Supercritical Water-cooled Reactor (SCWR), and Very High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR). These designs pursue goals of enhanced sustainability (e.g., improved fuel utilization, waste reduction through closed fuel cycles), improved economics, enhanced safety and reliability (often incorporating passive safety features), and increased proliferation resistance and physical protection. Many Gen IV designs operate at higher temperatures than LWRs, enabling higher thermal efficiency and potential for non-electric applications like hydrogen production or industrial process heat, and often utilize a fast neutron spectrum to enable breeding of new fuel and transmutation of long-lived waste products.
SMRs, generally defined as reactors with electrical output up to 300 MWe, leverage modularity and factory fabrication to potentially reduce construction times and costs, improve scalability, and offer greater siting flexibility, including deployment in remote areas or integration with smaller grids. Many SMR designs also emphasize enhanced safety through passive systems and inherent characteristics. SMRs encompass a range of technologies, including scaled-down versions of LWRs as well as advanced Gen IV concepts.
Despite their promise, both Gen IV reactors and SMRs face significant hurdles to widespread deployment. Common challenges include the development and qualification of advanced materials capable of withstanding extreme operating conditions (high temperatures, corrosive coolants, intense radiation fields). Establishing and demonstrating sustainable closed fuel cycles, including efficient reprocessing technologies and effective waste management strategies like partitioning and transmutation (P&T), is critical for several concepts but technologically demanding. Achieving economic competitiveness, particularly for first-of-a-kind (FOAK) plants, remains a major barrier. Adapting existing licensing and regulatory frameworks to accommodate the novel designs, safety features, and fuel cycles of advanced reactors is a complex and time-consuming process. Validating the performance and reliability of passive safety systems under all relevant conditions is essential but challenging due to weak driving forces and limited data. Ensuring adequate proliferation resistance and developing effective safeguards approaches for new fuel cycles and reactor designs are critical for international acceptance. Finally, developing robust supply chains, establishing necessary fuel cycle infrastructure, ensuring sufficient qualified workforce, and gaining public acceptance are crucial enabling factors. A significant cross-cutting challenge, particularly for novel designs, is the lack of operating experience (OPEX) to inform design improvements, validate models, and build regulatory confidence.
B. Priority Research Areas for Advanced Fission Breakthroughs
Addressing the overarching challenges requires focused R&D efforts. Certain areas appear particularly critical yet relatively under-investigated compared to their potential impact on enabling advanced fission technologies.
1. Partitioning & Transmutation (P&T): Addressing Technical and Economic Gaps
Partitioning and Transmutation (P&T) represents a key strategy within advanced fuel cycles aimed at enhancing the sustainability of nuclear energy by reducing the long-term burden of nuclear waste. The process involves chemically separating (partitioning) the most problematic long-lived radionuclides—primarily minor actinides (MA: neptunium, americium, curium) and potentially some long-lived fission products (LLFPs: e.g., Tc-99, I-129)—from spent nuclear fuel (SNF). These separated elements are then converted (transmuted) into shorter-lived or stable isotopes, typically through neutron capture and fission reactions in dedicated nuclear systems, most effectively fast-spectrum reactors or Accelerator-Driven Systems (ADS). By removing the major contributors to long-term radiotoxicity and heat load, P&T could significantly reduce the required isolation time for geological repositories and potentially increase repository capacity, thereby addressing key waste management challenges. This aligns with the sustainability goals defined for Gen IV systems.
Despite the clear potential benefits, the practical implementation of P&T faces substantial technical and economic hurdles that appear under-resourced relative to the scale of the challenge. There exists a significant gap between the theoretical promise of P&T and its demonstrated feasibility and cost-effectiveness at an industrial scale. While P&T is actively researched internationally , key under-investigated areas revolve around achieving the necessary process efficiencies reliably, managing the complexities of dedicated transmutation systems, and performing credible economic and system-level assessments compared to alternative waste management strategies like direct disposal.
 * Specific Under-Researched P&T Areas/Gaps:
   * High-Efficiency, Industrial-Scale Partitioning: Achieving the extremely high separation efficiencies required for effective P&T (e.g., >99.9% recovery of minor actinides cited in ) from highly radioactive spent fuel is a formidable chemical engineering challenge. Residual amounts not separated would still require long-term disposal, diminishing the benefits. Difficulties arise from the similar chemical behavior of lanthanides and actinides, the degradation of chemical reagents and equipment under intense radiation, and the need for fully remote, robust, and reliable operations. Research gaps persist in developing and demonstrating advanced partitioning processes—both aqueous methods (e.g., modifications to PUREX, group actinide separation concepts ) and pyrochemical processing (pyroprocessing )—that can achieve target efficiencies at scale, minimize the generation of secondary waste streams , enhance proliferation resistance , and are economically viable.
   * Transmutation System Efficiency, Safety, and Cost: Transmuting separated minor actinides requires specialized nuclear systems. Fast reactors (like SFR, LFR, GFR) possess suitable neutron spectra but incorporating significant quantities of MAs into their fuel can adversely affect core safety parameters (e.g., reducing the delayed neutron fraction and Doppler reactivity feedback ) and presents challenges in fuel fabrication and performance. Accelerator-Driven Systems (ADS), which use a high-energy particle accelerator to drive a subcritical reactor core, offer potential safety advantages by avoiding criticality accidents. However, ADS requires the development of extremely reliable and powerful (megawatt-class beam power) accelerators and robust spallation targets capable of producing intense neutron fluxes, which represents a significant technological and cost challenge. Research is needed to optimize transmutation rates in both reactor types, thoroughly assess and mitigate safety impacts, improve the reliability and reduce the cost of ADS components (accelerator, target, subcritical core), and critically evaluate the practicality and net benefit of transmuting LLFPs.
   * Integrated Fuel Cycle Modeling and Holistic Economic Assessment: P&T involves a complex, multi-stage fuel cycle including SNF storage, partitioning, MA-bearing fuel fabrication, transmutation in a dedicated facility, and management of residual wastes and fission products. The overall system performance and economic viability depend critically on the efficiencies, costs, and interdependencies of all these steps. Comprehensive systems analyses are needed to compare different P&T scenarios (e.g., homogeneous vs. heterogeneous recycling ) against direct disposal or simpler recycling options (e.g., Pu recycle in MOX fuel). However, such analyses are often hampered by significant uncertainties in technological readiness, cost estimations over very long timescales, and assumptions about future repository performance and societal values. Under-researched aspects include optimizing the integration and logistics of the entire P&T fuel cycle and performing robust, unbiased economic comparisons that account for full lifecycle costs and benefits. DOE identifies partitioning and transmutation (specifically ATW/ADS) as areas needing technology development.
   * Minor Actinide Bearing Fuels (MA-Fuels): A prerequisite for transmutation is the development, fabrication, qualification, and licensing of fuels containing high concentrations of separated minor actinides (Am, Cm). These fuels present significant challenges due to the high radioactivity, heat generation, and difficult handling properties of Am and Cm. Research gaps exist in identifying suitable fuel forms (oxides, nitrides, metallic alloys, inert matrix fuels ), developing remote fabrication techniques, understanding their in-reactor performance (swelling, restructuring, interaction with cladding) under intense fast neutron irradiation, and assessing their behavior during reprocessing.
2. Advanced Accident-Tolerant Fuels (ATF): Beyond LWR Applications
The development of Accident Tolerant Fuels (ATF) emerged as a major R&D focus following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident, aiming to enhance the safety margins of nuclear reactors, primarily existing and future Light Water Reactors (LWRs). The core objective is to develop fuel and cladding materials that can better withstand severe accident conditions, particularly loss-of-coolant accidents (LOCAs), for longer durations compared to the standard UO₂ fuel pellets and zirconium-alloy (Zircaloy) cladding. Key performance goals include reduced oxidation kinetics in high-temperature steam (leading to less hydrogen generation), improved retention of fission products, and enhanced mechanical integrity at high temperatures. Several concepts are under active development and testing, generally categorized into near-term options (evolutionary changes like chromium-coated Zircaloy cladding, iron-chromium-aluminum (FeCrAl) alloys, and doped UO₂ fuels) and longer-term concepts (more revolutionary changes like silicon carbide composite (SiC/SiC) cladding and advanced fuel forms such as uranium silicide (U₃Si₂) or uranium nitride (UN)).
While ATF development holds significant promise for improving LWR safety and potentially enabling enhanced operational performance (e.g., higher burnup), the research focus has been overwhelmingly concentrated on LWR-specific conditions. Advanced reactors, including Gen IV concepts and SMRs, operate under substantially different conditions—employing diverse coolants (liquid metals, molten salts, gases), higher operating temperatures, different neutron energy spectra (often fast), and potentially novel fuel management strategies. The applicability, potential benefits, and specific R&D requirements for deploying ATF technologies in these non-LWR systems appear significantly under-investigated, representing a potential missed opportunity for synergistic safety and performance enhancements across the broader nuclear landscape.
 * Specific Under-Researched ATF Areas for Advanced Reactors:
   * ATF Performance Evaluation in Advanced Reactor Environments: The behavior of candidate ATF materials under the unique conditions of advanced reactors is largely unknown. Most testing, modeling, and qualification efforts are tailored to the thermal neutron spectrum, water/steam coolant, and temperature/pressure regimes of LWRs. Systematic research is needed to evaluate the fundamental performance of promising ATF concepts (e.g., SiC/SiC composites, FeCrAl alloys, advanced fuel pellets like U₃Si₂ or UN) in environments representative of Gen IV reactors. This includes assessing their thermal and mechanical properties at higher temperatures, chemical compatibility with non-aqueous coolants (liquid metals, molten salts, helium), irradiation behavior under fast neutron spectra (different damage mechanisms, transmutation rates), and response during accident scenarios specific to these reactor types.
   * Coolant Compatibility of ATF Cladding: Chemical interactions between ATF cladding materials and novel coolants are a critical uncertainty. For instance, the long-term stability and corrosion resistance of SiC/SiC composites or FeCrAl alloys in flowing high-temperature molten salts or liquid metals (sodium, lead) under irradiation need thorough investigation. Degradation mechanisms, such as dissolution, oxidation, or embrittlement, may differ significantly from those observed in LWR water chemistry, requiring dedicated experimental campaigns and model development.
   * Fuel Cycle Integration of Advanced ATF Forms: Some ATF concepts involve advanced fuel materials (e.g., U₃Si₂, UN) offering higher uranium density and potentially improved thermal conductivity compared to UO₂. However, these alternative fuel forms pose challenges for back-end fuel cycle management, particularly reprocessing and waste disposal. Research is needed to assess their compatibility with existing or planned reprocessing technologies (e.g., PUREX for aqueous, pyroprocessing for some advanced cycles) and their behavior as waste forms. The overall spent fuel management strategy for all types of ATF requires more detailed consideration.
   * Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Adaptation: Existing fuel performance codes, primarily benchmarked against UO₂-Zircaloy data in LWRs, need significant development and validation to accurately predict the behavior of diverse ATF concepts within the distinct operational and accident envelopes of non-LWR designs. This includes incorporating new material properties, constitutive models for different degradation mechanisms (e.g., corrosion in salts/metals, fast spectrum irradiation effects), and coupling with thermal-hydraulic codes suitable for advanced coolants.
   * Enabling Enhanced Safety in SMRs: ATF technology could potentially enhance the passive safety characteristics of SMRs by significantly extending the time available before core damage occurs during accidents, potentially enabling "walk-away safe" designs where no immediate operator intervention is required. Quantifying this potential benefit requires specific research focusing on the synergy between particular ATF concepts and SMR designs, including integrated safety analyses under SMR-specific transient scenarios.
3. Modeling & Simulation (M&S) for Non-LWRs: Validation and Phenomena Gaps
Modeling and simulation (M&S) tools are indispensable for the design, safety analysis, and licensing of nuclear reactors. They allow engineers and regulators to predict reactor behavior under normal operation and accident conditions, optimize designs, and assess safety margins, often reducing the need for costly and time-consuming large-scale experiments. However, the current M&S capabilities, largely developed and validated over decades for the existing fleet of LWRs, face significant challenges when applied to the diverse range of advanced non-LWR designs. These advanced reactors often feature fundamentally different coolants (liquid metals, molten salts, gases), materials (advanced alloys, ceramics, graphite), core geometries, neutron energy spectra (fast or epithermal), and rely on different physical phenomena (e.g., natural circulation, complex chemical interactions). Consequently, existing codes may not adequately capture the relevant physics, and new or significantly modified codes require rigorous validation against experimental data specific to these novel systems.
The scarcity of relevant experimental data for non-LWR conditions represents a major bottleneck hindering the development, validation, and regulatory acceptance of the advanced M&S tools required for these next-generation reactors. While code development efforts, such as those under the DOE's Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS) program , are progressing, the lack of high-quality validation experiments limits the confidence in these tools. This necessitates a strategic, parallel investment in generating benchmark-quality experimental data specifically designed to test and validate code predictions for key non-LWR phenomena.
 * Specific Under-Researched M&S Areas/Gaps:
   * Validation Data Scarcity and Experimental Needs: The most critical gap is the lack of comprehensive, high-quality experimental data suitable for validating M&S codes across the range of conditions and phenomena relevant to non-LWRs. This includes data on thermal-hydraulics (e.g., heat transfer coefficients, flow patterns, turbulence characteristics) in novel coolants like liquid metals and molten salts, neutronics data for fast and epithermal spectra, data on coupled multi-physics effects, fuel and material performance under relevant irradiation and environmental conditions, fission product transport, and passive system behavior. Designing and executing dedicated separate-effects and integral-effects tests to generate this validation data is a high-priority need.
   * Advanced Multi-Physics Coupling: Non-LWR systems often exhibit stronger coupling between different physics domains—neutronics, thermal-hydraulics, structural mechanics, materials degradation (corrosion, irradiation damage), and chemical transport (fission products, tritium)—than traditional LWRs. Developing and validating high-fidelity simulation tools capable of accurately capturing these tightly coupled interactions, potentially across multiple length and time scales (multi-scale modeling), remains a significant R&D challenge. Programs like NEAMS aim to address this, but robust validation is key.
   * Modeling of Novel Physical Phenomena: Specific physical processes that are unique or particularly important in advanced reactors require improved fundamental understanding and accurate modeling capabilities. Examples include: turbulent MHD flows and heat transfer in liquid metal blankets ; complex thermochemistry, solubility, and transport phenomena in molten salt fuels and coolants ; fission product release and transport mechanisms in TRISO fuel particles and graphite matrix materials for HTGRs ; the behavior of advanced fuel forms (metallic, nitride, silicide, ATF concepts); and the dynamics of passive safety systems driven by natural forces.
   * Mechanistic Source Term (MST) Modeling: Predicting the potential release of radionuclides from the reactor system to the environment (the source term) is a cornerstone of safety analysis and licensing. For advanced reactors, a shift from conservative, bounding analyses towards more realistic, mechanistic source term (MST) modeling is anticipated. This requires developing and validating models that accurately account for the transport, retention, and chemical behavior of radionuclides within the specific materials (fuel, coolant, structures) and under the operating and accident conditions of each advanced reactor concept (HTGR, MSR, SFR, LFR). Significant gaps exist in validated MST codes for these systems.
   * Verification, Validation, and Uncertainty Quantification (V&V/UQ): As new codes are developed or existing codes are extended for non-LWR applications, rigorous V&V processes are essential to ensure their accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods are needed to assess the confidence level in simulation predictions and establish adequate safety margins for regulatory acceptance. Developing standardized V&V/UQ methodologies applicable to the diverse range of non-LWR phenomena and addressing the challenge of limited validation data is an important research need.
4. Validating Passive Safety Systems in Novel Designs: Specific Needs
A prominent feature of many advanced reactor designs, including both Gen IV concepts and SMRs, is the increased reliance on passive safety systems. These systems are designed to perform safety functions (such as reactor shutdown, decay heat removal, or containment cooling) without requiring external power sources or operator intervention, instead utilizing natural physical forces like gravity, natural circulation, convection, or pressure differences. The intent is to enhance overall reactor safety and resilience by reducing dependence on active components (pumps, diesel generators) that could fail during accidents. Examples include gravity-driven control rods, natural circulation cooling loops, pressure-suppression pools, and passive containment cooling systems.
While the concept of passive safety is appealing and offers potential advantages, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of these systems across the full spectrum of potential accident scenarios and operational states poses significant challenges, particularly for novel reactor designs lacking extensive operational experience. The driving forces for passive systems (e.g., density differences causing natural circulation) are often weak compared to active systems, making their performance potentially sensitive to subtle factors like thermal stratification, non-condensable gas accumulation, or geometric details. Consequently, substantiating claims of enhanced safety through passive features requires robust validation beyond conceptual design, relying heavily on experimental data and rigorously validated simulation tools. This validation gap appears particularly acute for innovative non-LWR designs and represents a critical hurdle for licensing and deployment.
 * Specific Under-Researched Passive Safety Validation Areas/Gaps:
   * Integral Effect Test (IET) Facilities: Understanding the complex interactions between multiple passive systems and the overall reactor behavior during transients often requires large-scale IET facilities. These facilities aim to simulate the integrated response of the reactor system under prototypical or appropriately scaled conditions (pressure, temperature, geometry). However, designing, constructing, and operating such facilities, especially for diverse non-LWR concepts with unique coolants and geometries, is extremely expensive and time-consuming. A lack of suitable IET facilities tailored to specific advanced reactor designs hinders the generation of comprehensive validation data for passive system performance.
   * Code Validation for Passive Phenomena: Simulation codes used to analyze passive safety system performance must be capable of accurately modeling the underlying physical phenomena, such as natural circulation (single-phase and two-phase), heat transfer in complex geometries under low-flow conditions, mixing and stratification, condensation/evaporation, and the behavior of non-condensable gases. Validating these codes against relevant experimental data, from separate-effects tests to integral tests, is crucial but challenging due to the complexity and often subtle nature of passive phenomena driven by weak forces.
   * Long-Term Performance and Reliability Assessment: Passive systems must remain functional and reliable throughout the reactor's lifetime (typically 60 years or more). Assessing potential degradation mechanisms that could affect long-term performance—such as corrosion, fouling of heat transfer surfaces, aging of materials, or potential blockage of flow paths—requires further research. Developing methodologies for accelerated testing or predictive modeling of long-term reliability for passive components operating under potentially stagnant or low-flow conditions is an important gap.
   * System Interactions and Complex Scenarios: The performance of a passive system can be influenced by the state of other reactor systems (both passive and active) and by external events. Understanding these complex interactions during various accident sequences, including scenarios involving multiple failures or external hazards like earthquakes (which could potentially impede gravity-driven systems ), requires sophisticated system-level modeling and potentially integrated experimental investigation.
   * Scaling Laws and Extrapolation: Experimental validation is often performed in scaled-down facilities. Accurately extrapolating the results from these experiments to the full-scale reactor system requires well-established and validated scaling laws. Developing and validating appropriate scaling methodologies for passive systems, particularly those dominated by natural circulation and complex thermal-hydraulic phenomena, can be difficult and represents an area needing further research.
5. Material Compatibility in Novel Coolants: Unresolved Corrosion Issues
A defining characteristic of many Gen IV reactor concepts is the use of novel coolants operating at significantly higher temperatures compared to traditional LWRs, aiming for improved thermal efficiency and enabling new applications. These coolants include liquid metals like sodium (SFR) and lead or lead-bismuth eutectic (LFR), molten fluoride or chloride salts (MSR), supercritical water (SCWR), and high-temperature helium gas (VHTR, GFR). Ensuring the long-term compatibility and structural integrity of reactor materials (fuel cladding, core structures, heat exchangers, piping) when exposed to these chemically aggressive and high-temperature environments, often under intense irradiation, is a paramount challenge and a critical feasibility issue for these advanced designs. Corrosion, erosion, environmentally assisted cracking, and other degradation mechanisms must be thoroughly understood and mitigated through materials selection, coolant chemistry control, and potentially protective coatings.
While materials development is crucial, perhaps an underestimated challenge lies in the precise monitoring and control of the coolant chemistry itself. The corrosivity of molten salts, liquid metals, and even high-temperature gases is often highly sensitive to the concentration of impurities (e.g., oxygen, water, dissolved metals) or the electrochemical potential (redox state) of the fluid. Maintaining the coolant chemistry within stringent specifications under operating conditions (high temperature, radiation) is essential for ensuring predictable and acceptable material performance. However, developing reliable, robust online sensors and efficient purification systems capable of operating in these harsh environments appears to be a significant research and engineering gap, fundamental to the long-term viability of most Gen IV concepts.
 * Specific Under-Researched Material Compatibility Areas/Gaps:
   * Molten Salt Corrosion: MSRs, using either fluoride or chloride salts as fuel carriers or coolants at temperatures potentially exceeding 700-800°C, face severe corrosion challenges. Key research gaps include: developing a fundamental understanding of corrosion mechanisms (e.g., selective leaching of alloying elements like chromium from nickel-based alloys , intergranular attack, tellurium-induced cracking); identifying and qualifying highly resistant structural alloys (historically Hastelloy-N/INOR-8 , now considering advanced Ni-alloys or potentially refractory metals ); developing and validating methods for online monitoring and control of salt chemistry (particularly redox potential, which strongly influences corrosion ); assessing the synergistic effects of irradiation and corrosion ; and developing real-time corrosion monitoring techniques. Graphite moderator compatibility and degradation in salt environments is also a concern.
   * Liquid Metal Corrosion (Sodium, Lead, LBE): SFRs, operating with liquid sodium typically up to 550°C, require careful control of impurities (especially oxygen) to minimize corrosion of stainless steel components. LFRs, using molten lead or lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) at potentially higher temperatures (up to 800°C in some concepts), face significant challenges with corrosion and dissolution of common structural steels (ferritic-martensitic, austenitic). Liquid metal embrittlement (LME) is also a potential concern, particularly with LBE. Research needs include developing corrosion-resistant materials (e.g., alumina-forming steels, refractory metals), effective protective coatings, understanding mass transfer phenomena in flowing liquid metals, and reliable coolant chemistry control and monitoring systems. The opacity and high density of lead/LBE also pose challenges for inspection and handling.
   * Supercritical Water (SCWR) Corrosion: SCWRs operate with water above its thermodynamic critical point (374°C, 22.1 MPa), potentially reaching temperatures of 500-625°C. This unique environment presents challenges related to stress corrosion cracking (SCC), general corrosion, and potentially hydrogen embrittlement for fuel cladding and structural materials. Developing and qualifying materials (e.g., advanced stainless steels, nickel alloys) that can withstand these conditions, along with defining appropriate water chemistry control strategies, are critical research needs.
   * High-Temperature Gas (VHTR/GFR) Interactions: VHTRs and GFRs utilize helium coolant at very high temperatures (up to 900-1000°C for VHTR, 850°C for GFR). While helium itself is inert, trace impurities (e.g., H₂O, CO, H₂, CH₄ originating from graphite components or ingress) can cause significant oxidation, carburization, or decarburization of metallic structural materials (e.g., Ni-based superalloys, potentially refractory alloys) and degradation of graphite moderator/reflector components. Key research gaps involve understanding these gas-material interactions under reactor conditions, developing methods for stringent coolant purification and impurity monitoring, and qualifying materials and coatings with sufficient long-term resistance. Graphite behavior under combined high temperature and irradiation is also crucial.
   * Irradiation-Assisted Corrosion and Stress Corrosion Cracking (IAC/IASCC): The combination of intense neutron irradiation and a corrosive coolant environment can lead to synergistic degradation effects that are often more severe than either effect alone. Radiation can alter material microstructure and composition (e.g., through radiation-induced segregation), making it more susceptible to corrosion or SCC. Conversely, corrosion can affect how radiation damage evolves. Understanding and predicting IAC/IASCC phenomena in the specific coolant chemistries and irradiation conditions of advanced reactors is a major research gap, requiring sophisticated experiments in specialized facilities capable of simulating combined environments.
III. Forward-Thinking Energy Concepts: Identifying Critical Research Needs
Beyond advancing fusion and fission, achieving long-term energy sustainability may benefit from exploring entirely novel or "forward-thinking" energy production concepts. These often promise unique advantages but typically face even greater scientific and technological uncertainties than Gen IV or mainstream fusion approaches. Identifying and addressing their most critical, under-researched hurdles is necessary to realistically assess their potential.
A. Aneutronic Fusion: Key Hurdles to Viability
Aneutronic fusion seeks to minimize the production of energetic neutrons by utilizing fuel cycles where the primary fusion reaction products are charged particles (ions and electrons). Prominent examples include reactions involving deuterium and helium-3 (D-³He) or protons and boron-11 (p-¹¹B). The potential advantages are significant: reduced material activation and damage, potentially eliminating the need for tritium breeding, simplified shielding requirements, and the possibility of highly efficient direct energy conversion (DEC). However, these fuel cycles are significantly more challenging to achieve than the deuterium-tritium (D-T) reaction pursued by mainstream fusion efforts.
Realizing practical aneutronic fusion requires overcoming several substantial, interconnected obstacles simultaneously. Progress limited to only one area, such as confinement, is insufficient if critical enabling technologies like high-efficiency DEC or viable fuel sources remain underdeveloped. The current R&D landscape appears somewhat fragmented, often focusing on specific components rather than the integrated system challenges. This makes aneutronic fusion a high-risk, potentially high-reward area critically dependent on achieving multiple, concurrent breakthroughs.
 * Specific Under-Researched Aneutronic Fusion Areas/Gaps:
   * Achieving and Sustaining Extreme Plasma Conditions: Aneutronic reactions have significantly lower fusion cross-sections and typically occur at much higher optimal temperatures compared to D-T. For example, p-¹¹B fusion requires temperatures roughly nine times higher than D-T (peak reactivity around 600 keV vs. 66 keV). Furthermore, energy losses from bremsstrahlung radiation (X-rays emitted when electrons decelerate near ions) become much more severe at these higher temperatures and for fuels with higher atomic numbers (Z). Consequently, achieving ignition (self-sustained burn) requires substantially better energy confinement (a significantly higher Lawson criterion value, potentially 50 times higher for D-³He than D-T ) and higher plasma energy density. Developing confinement concepts and heating methods capable of reaching and maintaining these extreme conditions against high radiation losses represents a major, fundamental physics gap far beyond current D-T capabilities.
   * Efficient High-Energy Direct Energy Conversion (DEC): Since the majority of energy is released as energetic charged particles (MeV range protons and alpha particles ), efficient DEC is not just beneficial but likely essential for the viability of aneutronic fusion. As discussed previously (Section I.B.4), developing and validating DEC systems capable of handling these multi-MeV particles with high efficiency (>80-90%) and adequate power density is a critical, under-researched enabling technology.
   * Fuel Supply (Helium-3): While p-¹¹B fuel is abundant, the D-³He cycle relies on helium-3, an isotope that is extremely rare on Earth. Proposed solutions include breeding ³He from D-D fusion reactions (which also produce neutrons and tritium), collecting ³He from the decay of tritium produced in fission or fusion reactors, or extraterrestrial mining (e.g., from the lunar surface where it is deposited by solar wind). All these options involve significant technological development, infrastructure investment, and logistical challenges, representing major hurdles to the D-³He pathway that require substantial, long-term research.
   * Managing Side Reactions and Residual Neutrons: Although termed "aneutronic," most proposed fuel cycles are not entirely free of neutron production. Parasitic side reactions, such as D-D reactions occurring in a D-³He plasma, or secondary reactions between fusion products and fuel ions, can generate some level of neutron flux. While significantly lower than in D-T fusion, these residual neutrons still necessitate some level of shielding, contribute to material activation, and require accurate modeling and measurement to assess their impact on reactor design and safety.
   * Suitable Confinement Concepts: The high operating temperatures and dominant radiation losses (bremsstrahlung) associated with aneutronic fuels pose severe challenges for traditional magnetic confinement devices like tokamaks. Alternative confinement concepts might be better suited, such as Field-Reversed Configurations (FRCs) which offer high beta , Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC) devices , or perhaps novel approaches driven by intense lasers or particle beams. However, these alternative concepts themselves require significant R&D to demonstrate the necessary confinement performance (see Section I.B.1).
B. Fusion-Fission Hybrids (FFH): Overcoming Integration and Assessment Gaps
Fusion-Fission Hybrid (FFH) systems represent a potential bridge between fusion and fission technologies, aiming to leverage the strengths of both. The core concept involves surrounding a neutron-producing fusion core (the "driver") with a subcritical fission blanket. The energetic neutrons from the fusion reactions (typically 14 MeV from D-T) drive fission reactions in the blanket. Potential applications include: breeding fissile fuel (e.g., U-233 from thorium, or Pu-239 from U-238) to supply conventional fission reactors; transmuting problematic long-lived nuclear waste (minor actinides) from spent fission fuel; or generating power directly from the fission reactions in the blanket, potentially with enhanced safety due to the subcritical nature of the fission assembly. A key potential advantage is that the requirements on the fusion driver (e.g., energy gain Q, plasma confinement) might be significantly relaxed compared to those needed for pure fusion energy, potentially accelerating the application of fusion neutron sources.
Despite these potential synergies, the development of FFH systems faces significant challenges, and currently receives little to no dedicated R&D funding within major programs like the U.S. DOE. A fundamental issue, highlighted in expert workshops, is the lack of rigorous, quantitative assessments comparing the potential benefits and costs of hybrid systems against advanced fission-only solutions (like fast breeder or burner reactors) designed to accomplish the same missions (fuel breeding or waste transmutation). Without such comparative analyses and dedicated R&D addressing the unique integration challenges, the potential role and viability of FFH remain highly uncertain and speculative.
 * Specific Under-Researched FFH Areas/Gaps:
   * System Integration and Interface Technologies: The physical and operational coupling of a fusion neutron source (whether tokamak, stellarator, mirror, or inertial fusion based) with a surrounding fission blanket presents formidable engineering challenges that are largely unexplored experimentally. Key issues include: managing heat transfer and thermal stresses between the high-temperature fusion environment and the fission blanket; addressing MHD effects if liquid metal coolants/breeders are used in the blanket within the fusion device's magnetic field ; ensuring nuclear safety and control across the coupled system; developing robust remote handling and maintenance procedures for complex, highly activated components ; and mitigating potential electromagnetic and mechanical interactions between the fusion and fission systems. These interface technologies require significant, dedicated R&D.
   * Neutronics and Blanket Design Optimization: Designing a fission blanket optimized for a specific hybrid mission (e.g., maximizing fuel breeding ratio, achieving high actinide transmutation rates, or ensuring efficient power extraction) requires sophisticated neutronic modeling and validation. The external fusion neutron source introduces unique physics compared to critical fission reactors, affecting power distribution, reactivity control, and material damage rates. Advanced blanket concepts proposed for hybrids, such as those using flowing liquid fuels (e.g., molten salts) or very deep-burn solid fuels to minimize reprocessing needs, require substantial fuel development and testing.
   * Fusion Driver Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM): Even with relaxed physics requirements (lower Q), the fusion neutron source for a hybrid system must operate with high reliability and availability (potentially 50-75% or higher cited in ) to be practical for continuous fuel production or waste transmutation. Current fusion experiments operate intermittently, and even ITER is projected to have a low overall duty factor during its operational lifetime. Achieving the required RAM performance for the fusion driver represents a major gap in fusion technology development, essential for hybrid viability. Concepts involving periodic replacement of the entire fusion core have been suggested to simplify maintenance but require validation.
   * Comparative Economics and Proliferation Risk Assessment: Credible, unbiased techno-economic assessments are needed to compare the lifecycle costs and benefits of FFH systems against advanced fission-only alternatives (e.g., fast reactors with integrated reprocessing) for achieving specific fuel cycle objectives. These assessments must consider the costs of developing and deploying both the fusion driver and the specialized fission blanket and associated fuel cycle facilities. Similarly, the proliferation resistance characteristics of various hybrid fuel cycles, particularly those involving reprocessing and separation of fissile materials, need rigorous evaluation compared to fission-only cycles.
   * Safety Analysis and Licensing Framework: Establishing a comprehensive safety case and a viable licensing pathway for a coupled fusion-fission system presents unique regulatory challenges. This requires addressing potential accident scenarios involving interactions between the fusion and fission components and developing appropriate safety standards and regulatory criteria, an area that has received little attention to date.
C. Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS): Under-Researched Subsurface Challenges
Geothermal energy harnesses heat from the Earth's interior, offering a potential source of clean, reliable, baseload power and direct heat. Conventional hydrothermal systems rely on naturally occurring combinations of hot rock, permeable pathways, and sufficient fluid (water or steam). Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) aim to vastly expand the potential of geothermal energy by engineering artificial reservoirs in areas that possess hot rock but lack sufficient natural permeability or fluid content. This typically involves drilling wells into deep, hot rock formations and then stimulating (fracturing) the rock mass to create or enhance flow pathways, allowing a heat transfer fluid (usually water) to be circulated between injection and production wells to extract heat. EGS technology could potentially unlock enormous energy resources estimated to be capable of powering millions of homes in the U.S. alone and is geographically widespread.
While EGS leverages technologies and expertise from the oil and gas industry (e.g., drilling, hydraulic fracturing), it faces unique and significant challenges related to operating in typically harder, hotter, and more chemically complex geological environments. The success of EGS hinges critically on mastering the engineering of the subsurface reservoir. The primary under-investigated challenge lies in moving beyond site-specific, trial-and-error approaches to develop reliable, predictable, and cost-effective methods for creating and managing these artificial reservoirs across the diverse geological settings where EGS potential exists. This requires fundamental advances in understanding rock mechanics, fluid flow, and heat transport under relevant conditions, supported by robust modeling and monitoring techniques.
 * Specific Under-Researched EGS Areas/Gaps:
   * Predictable Reservoir Creation and Stimulation: The core challenge of EGS is reliably engineering a subsurface fracture network with sufficient permeability and surface area for efficient heat exchange between multiple wells, sustained over decades. Current stimulation techniques (hydraulic fracturing, potentially chemical or thermal stimulation ) adapted from oil and gas often yield unpredictable results in the typically crystalline, low-permeability, high-temperature rock targeted for EGS. Research gaps include: developing a fundamental understanding of fracture initiation and propagation in hot, hard rock under various stress regimes; optimizing stimulation strategies for different geological settings; predicting and controlling the geometry and connectivity of the created fracture network to avoid rapid thermal breakthrough (short-circuiting); and developing effective techniques for real-time monitoring and imaging of reservoir evolution during and after stimulation. Initiatives like the DOE's Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) project are crucial for addressing these gaps through field-scale experimentation.
   * Cost-Effective Drilling in Hard, Hot Rock: Accessing EGS resources often requires drilling deeper wells (potentially 4-8 km or more ) through significantly harder and hotter rock formations than encountered in typical sedimentary basins. This leads to substantially higher drilling costs, which constitute a major portion of EGS project capital expenditure. Key research needs include developing advanced drilling technologies capable of efficiently penetrating hard, abrasive rock (e.g., improved drill bits, alternative drilling methods like directional, slim-hole, or potentially energy-based drilling), high-temperature downhole tools, sensors, and electronics capable of surviving conditions exceeding 200-300°C, and effective strategies for managing drilling fluid losses in fractured formations. Ensuring long-term wellbore integrity through durable casing and cementing materials resistant to high temperatures and potentially corrosive fluids is also critical and requires improved evaluation methods.
   * Induced Seismicity Understanding and Mitigation: Injecting fluids at pressure to stimulate EGS reservoirs inevitably causes microseismicity, and carries a risk of inducing larger, potentially felt earthquakes. While the risk is generally considered manageable, public perception and regulatory acceptance hinge on effectively mitigating and communicating this risk. Research gaps include: improving the understanding of the complex relationship between injection parameters (pressure, volume, rate), local geology (fault structures, stress state), and the magnitude and frequency of induced seismic events; developing reliable protocols for real-time seismic monitoring and adaptive reservoir management ("traffic light systems") to minimize the risk of felt events; and establishing effective frameworks for public engagement and risk communication.
   * Sustainable Heat Extraction and Reservoir Management: Maintaining the thermal output and fluid flow rates of an EGS reservoir over a project lifetime of 30 years or more without excessive temperature decline (thermal drawdown) or fluid loss is essential for economic viability. Research is needed on optimizing well placement strategies, managing injection and production flow rates to maximize heat recovery while preventing premature cooling of the reservoir, understanding and potentially mitigating geochemical issues like mineral dissolution and precipitation (scaling) or corrosion caused by reactive fluids at high temperatures , and assessing the long-term evolution of reservoir permeability and flow paths. Sustainable water management, particularly in arid regions, is also crucial, requiring investigation into water recycling, use of non-potable water sources, or potentially alternative working fluids like supercritical CO₂.
   * Exploration and Characterization of Superhot Resources: Accessing geothermal resources at "superhot" conditions (temperatures potentially exceeding 400°C, possibly in a supercritical fluid state ) offers the potential for significantly higher energy conversion efficiency and power output per well. However, drilling, stimulating, and operating in such extreme temperature and pressure regimes pushes materials science, drilling technology, and reservoir engineering well beyond current capabilities, representing a frontier research area with substantial knowledge gaps.
D. Space-Based Solar Power (SBSP): Critical Path Technology and Economic Gaps
Space-Based Solar Power (SBSP) envisions collecting solar energy using large satellites in orbit, where sunlight is constantly available and more intense than on Earth's surface, and then transmitting that energy wirelessly via microwave or laser beams to receiving stations (rectennas) on the ground for conversion into electricity. Proponents suggest SBSP could provide a source of continuous, dispatchable, clean energy, potentially deliverable anywhere on Earth, overcoming the intermittency and land-use constraints of terrestrial solar power. The concept has been studied for decades, but recent advances in areas like photovoltaics, wireless power transmission (WPT), and launch vehicle technology have renewed interest.
However, realizing SBSP faces immense technological and economic challenges. While progress is being made in component technologies like WPT and solar cells, the feasibility of SBSP appears overwhelmingly dominated by two critical enabling factors: the need for dramatically lower space launch costs and the capability for large-scale, autonomous in-space assembly and manufacturing (ISAM). Until these foundational space logistics barriers are overcome, SBSP remains largely conceptual, irrespective of incremental improvements in energy conversion or transmission efficiency. Significant R&D focus on these enabling space infrastructure capabilities seems prerequisite for SBSP viability.
 * Specific Under-Researched SBSP Areas/Gaps:
   * Ultra-Low Launch Costs: Deploying the massive infrastructure required for SBSP—satellites potentially kilometers in size —necessitates launching thousands of tons of hardware into geostationary orbit (GEO) or other suitable orbits. Current launch costs, even with reusable rockets, make this economically prohibitive. Studies suggest launch costs may need to decrease by at least an order of magnitude (e.g., 10x reduction cited in ) for SBSP to become competitive. Achieving such drastic cost reductions requires revolutionary advances in launch vehicle technology, scale, and operational cadence far beyond current projections, representing a primary feasibility gap.
   * In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM): Constructing kilometer-scale solar power satellites in orbit from components launched from Earth is an unprecedented engineering challenge. This requires sophisticated robotic systems capable of autonomous assembly, connection, and potentially fabrication of large, delicate structures in the space environment. Furthermore, maintaining these complex systems over decades, including repairs and component replacements, necessitates advanced autonomous servicing capabilities. Demonstrating ISAM capabilities at the scale required for SBSP is a major technological hurdle with limited current demonstration.
   * Efficient and Safe Wireless Power Transmission (WPT): While the basic principles of WPT using microwaves or lasers are established, scaling this technology to transmit gigawatt-levels of power efficiently and safely over the ~36,000 km distance from GEO to Earth requires significant R&D. Key research gaps include: maximizing the end-to-end efficiency (DC power on satellite to AC power on grid); developing highly accurate beam pointing and tracking systems to ensure energy is delivered precisely to the receiving rectenna; understanding and mitigating atmospheric effects (absorption, scattering, particularly due to weather) on beam propagation ; ensuring the safety of the beam regarding potential biological effects or interference with aircraft or other satellites ; and optimizing the design and reducing the cost of large ground-based rectenna arrays.
   * High-Performance, Lightweight, Space-Durable Solar Arrays: Given the constraints of launch mass, SBSP satellites require photovoltaic (PV) arrays with very high power-to-mass ratios. This necessitates continued R&D into advanced PV technologies (e.g., thin-film, multi-junction cells) that offer high efficiency (target of 40% suggested in ), low mass, and long-term durability in the space environment (resistance to radiation damage, thermal cycling). Lightweight structural designs for deploying and supporting these vast arrays are also critical.
   * Credible Economic Viability Assessment: Establishing a convincing economic case for SBSP is extremely challenging due to the massive upfront capital investment (estimated $10-20 billion for a 1 GW system ), long development timelines, and significant technological uncertainties. Credible lifecycle cost analyses are needed, comparing SBSP against the projected future costs of terrestrial alternatives (e.g., renewables combined with large-scale energy storage). Initial assessments, such as one by NASA OTPS, suggest SBSP would currently be more expensive than terrestrial options. Developing realistic business models and identifying potential financing mechanisms for such large-scale, long-term projects are critical gaps.
   * Environmental, Safety, and Regulatory Frameworks: Beyond technical and economic hurdles, SBSP faces significant non-technical challenges. These include assessing and mitigating potential environmental impacts (e.g., effects of microwave radiation on ecosystems or the atmosphere), ensuring the safety of WPT operations, managing the orbital debris risk associated with large satellite constellations, and establishing international agreements and regulations governing the use of orbital slots, transmission frequencies, and operational standards. Proactive public and stakeholder engagement is also necessary.
IV. Cross-Cutting Enabling Technologies: Foundational Research Gaps
Progress across multiple advanced energy domains—fusion, advanced fission, and potentially novel concepts—relies heavily on foundational advancements in cross-cutting scientific and engineering disciplines. Identifying and addressing research gaps in these enabling areas can yield benefits that ripple across the entire energy innovation landscape.
A. Materials Science for Combined Extreme Environments
A common thread linking the feasibility of fusion reactors and advanced fission concepts is the need for materials that can withstand unprecedentedly harsh operating environments. These environments often involve the simultaneous exposure of materials to multiple extreme stressors, including: extremely high temperatures (hundreds to potentially thousands of degrees Celsius); intense radiation fields (high-energy neutrons in fusion and fast fission reactors, gamma rays, energetic ions); highly corrosive fluids (liquid metals like sodium or lead, molten salts, supercritical water, reactive gases); high mechanical stresses (thermal stresses, pressure differentials, potentially cyclic loading); and, in the case of fusion, interactions with hydrogen isotopes, including tritium permeation and retention.
The most significant and pervasive research gap in this area appears to be the understanding and prediction of material behavior under the combined and synergistic effects of these multiple extreme conditions. Traditional materials research often focuses on isolating the effects of a single variable (e.g., temperature effects, or radiation damage alone, or corrosion in a specific fluid). However, in realistic reactor environments, these degradation mechanisms interact in complex ways: irradiation can alter microstructure and composition, thereby accelerating corrosion ; high temperatures accelerate both diffusion-driven damage processes and corrosion kinetics ; and applied stress can influence both radiation damage evolution and susceptibility to environmental cracking. Capturing these coupled phenomena requires a paradigm shift in research methodology, moving towards integrated experimental platforms capable of imposing multiple simultaneous stressors and developing validated multi-physics models that account for these interactions. This "coupled extremes" challenge is recognized as a critical basic research need by advisory bodies like BESAC  and is the focus of initiatives like the FUTURE Energy Frontier Research Center (EFRC) , but appears under-resourced relative to its fundamental importance across advanced energy systems.
 * Specific Under-Researched Materials Science Areas/Gaps:
   * Modeling and Validation of Synergistic Effects: Developing predictive computational models (from atomistic to continuum scales) that accurately capture the complex interplay between radiation damage, thermal effects, chemical corrosion/reactions, and mechanical stress is a major challenge. A primary limitation is the scarcity of high-quality experimental data obtained under well-characterized, combined extreme conditions, which is essential for validating these complex models.
   * Dedicated Multi-Stress Environmental Testing Facilities: There is a critical lack of experimental facilities worldwide capable of simultaneously subjecting materials to multiple relevant stressors, such as high-energy neutron irradiation combined with flowing corrosive coolants (liquid metal, molten salt) at high temperatures and under controlled mechanical loads. While specialized facilities exist or are planned for specific aspects (e.g., fusion neutron sources like FPNS , plasma exposure facilities like MPEX , fission test reactors ), integrated test stands capable of replicating the full complexity of advanced reactor environments are largely absent, hindering progress in understanding synergistic effects.
   * Advanced In-situ Characterization Techniques: Gaining fundamental insights into how materials evolve at the micro- and nano-scale during exposure to extreme environments requires the development and application of advanced in-situ characterization techniques. Examples include transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with ion irradiation and/or heating stages, synchrotron X-ray techniques for probing structure and chemistry in harsh environments, and novel methods like in-situ positron annihilation spectroscopy to track point defect evolution. Further development and wider accessibility of such techniques are needed.
   * Materials Solutions for Fusion Blankets and Plasma-Facing Components: Specific fusion material challenges requiring further research include: developing structural materials (e.g., advanced RAFM steels, ODS steels, refractory alloys, SiC/SiC composites) resistant to volumetric swelling, embrittlement (including helium effects), and loss of strength caused by high-energy (14 MeV) neutron bombardment at elevated temperatures; identifying PFC materials (e.g., tungsten, potentially liquid metals) capable of handling extreme heat (>10 MW/m²) and particle fluxes while minimizing erosion and plasma contamination; and ensuring compatibility with tritium breeding materials (Li, PbLi) and coolants.
   * Materials Solutions for Advanced Fission Reactors: Key needs include: developing alloys with superior corrosion resistance in specific novel coolants like high-temperature molten salts , liquid lead/LBE , or supercritical water ; ensuring compatibility with high-temperature helium containing impurities ; understanding and mitigating graphite degradation under irradiation and chemical attack ; and developing fuels and cladding (including ATF concepts) suitable for fast neutron spectra and high burnup operation.
B. Advanced Manufacturing: Qualification and Standardization Needs for Energy Components
Advanced manufacturing methods (AMMs), particularly additive manufacturing (AM), often referred to as 3D printing, hold significant potential to revolutionize the design, production, and maintenance of components for nuclear and fusion energy systems. AM enables the fabrication of highly complex geometries that are difficult or impossible to achieve with traditional manufacturing, potentially leading to improved performance (e.g., optimized cooling channels in fusion divertors or compact heat exchangers). It can also reduce material waste, shorten lead times for components (especially for replacements or repairs), and allow for the use of novel or functionally graded materials. Other AMMs like powder metallurgy with hot isostatic pressing (PM-HIP) and advanced welding techniques (e.g., electron beam welding) also offer benefits.
Despite this potential, the adoption of AMMs for safety-critical components in the nuclear and fusion sectors is proceeding cautiously. The primary bottleneck is not the ability to fabricate complex parts, but rather the significant challenges associated with qualifying these parts and processes to meet the extremely stringent quality, reliability, and performance requirements mandated by nuclear codes and standards (e.g., ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section III) and regulatory bodies. Demonstrating consistent material properties and predictable long-term performance for AM components, given the inherent variability of AM processes and the lack of extensive operational data, is a major hurdle, particularly for high-temperature applications where time-dependent degradation mechanisms like creep and fatigue are critical. Bridging the gap between AM capabilities and nuclear qualification requirements necessitates significant investment in data generation, standardization, and development of accepted qualification methodologies.
 * Specific Under-Researched Advanced Manufacturing Areas/Gaps:
   * Nuclear Qualification Pathways and Codification: A major barrier is the lack of clearly defined and widely accepted pathways for qualifying AM materials and processes for use in nuclear safety-related components. This requires developing consensus standards and code cases (like the initial efforts for 316L stainless steel via powder bed fusion mentioned in ) that address AM-specific aspects, including feedstock control, process parameter definition, post-processing treatments (like HIP), and material property characterization. Significant gaps exist in nuclear-specific AM standards. Collaboration between industry, standards development organizations (SDOs), and regulators is crucial.
   * Long-Term Performance Data Generation: Establishing the long-term reliability of AM components under demanding reactor conditions is essential but extremely challenging. Qualification for high-temperature service, governed by Section III, Division 5 of the ASME code, requires extensive and time-consuming creep, fatigue, and creep-fatigue testing (potentially requiring years of testing for a decades-long design life ). Generating this data for AM materials, considering the variability associated with different machines, parameters, and feedstock batches, is a major undertaking. The lack of this long-term data is a primary obstacle to developing high-temperature code cases for AM materials. Accelerated qualification methods, potentially incorporating validated modeling and simulation, are needed but require development and acceptance.
   * Process Monitoring, Control, and Quality Assurance: Ensuring the consistency and quality of AM parts requires robust methods for monitoring the manufacturing process in real-time and controlling key parameters to minimize defects (e.g., porosity, lack of fusion, micro-cracks) and ensure repeatable material properties. Developing reliable in-situ sensors, data analytics, and feedback control systems specifically tailored for producing nuclear-grade components via AM is an ongoing research need. Establishing comprehensive quality assurance programs covering the entire AM workflow (powder handling to final inspection) is also critical.
   * Non-Destructive Examination (NDE) for AM Defects: AM processes can produce unique defect types and microstructural features (e.g., fine-scale porosity, anisotropic grain structures, residual stresses) that may not be adequately detected or characterized by conventional NDE techniques developed for wrought or cast materials. Research and development are needed to adapt existing NDE methods (e.g., ultrasonic testing, radiography, eddy current) or develop new techniques specifically for assessing the integrity of AM components and identifying critical flaws. Establishing acceptance criteria for AM-specific indications is also required.
   * Irradiation Performance of AM Materials: The unique microstructures resulting from AM processes (e.g., fine cellular/dendritic structures, potentially high dislocation densities, specific textures) may influence how materials respond to neutron irradiation compared to their conventionally manufactured counterparts. More systematic studies are needed to understand the effects of irradiation on the mechanical properties (strength, ductility, fracture toughness), dimensional stability (swelling), and phase stability of AM alloys relevant to nuclear and fusion applications.
   * Application to Fusion-Specific Components and Materials: While AM is being explored for fission reactor components , its application to the highly complex geometries and specialized materials required for fusion reactors (e.g., divertor monoblocks with intricate cooling channels, functionally graded blanket components, plasma-facing structures made from tungsten alloys or potentially ceramics) presents distinct challenges and opportunities. Targeted R&D is needed to develop AM processes for fusion-relevant materials (e.g., W, RAFM steels, ODS steels, potentially ceramics or composites) and to explore how AM can enable innovative designs for enhanced performance (e.g., heat removal, tritium breeding) in the extreme fusion environment.
C. AI/Machine Learning (ML) Applications: Specific Gaps in Energy System Design, Control, and Discovery
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are increasingly recognized as powerful tools with the potential to significantly accelerate innovation and improve efficiency across the entire energy sector. Applications span optimizing the design and operation of energy systems (including advanced reactors and grids), enhancing predictive maintenance, enabling the stable integration of variable renewable energy sources, and dramatically speeding up the discovery and development of new materials for energy applications. Government agencies like DOE, through programs in the Office of Science and ARPA-E, are actively investing in AI/ML for energy, recognizing its strategic importance.
However, the effective and reliable application of AI/ML, particularly in the complex, high-consequence, and often data-limited environments characteristic of advanced energy systems like fusion and nuclear reactors, faces significant research gaps. Simply applying standard AI/ML algorithms developed for data-rich domains like image recognition or natural language processing is often insufficient or even inappropriate for these physics-rich, safety-critical applications. A critical need exists for the development of specialized AI/ML methodologies that are tailored to the unique challenges of the energy sector, incorporating domain knowledge (physics), handling uncertainty rigorously, providing transparency and explainability, and functioning reliably even with sparse or noisy data. This represents a distinct and under-investigated research direction compared to mainstream AI focused on "big data."
 * Specific Under-Researched AI/ML Areas/Gaps:
   * AI/ML for Sparse, Complex, and Physics-Rich Data: Many critical problems in advanced energy research—such as predicting fusion plasma behavior, simulating complex transients in advanced reactors, or modeling materials degradation under extreme conditions—suffer from a lack of the large, labeled datasets typically required for training deep learning models. Research is needed to develop and validate AI/ML techniques that can effectively learn from limited, high-dimensional, potentially noisy experimental or simulation data, while leveraging underlying physical principles. Promising avenues include physics-informed machine learning (PINN), transfer learning (adapting models trained on related data), generative AI for data augmentation, and reinforcement learning approaches designed for complex system modeling. The need to develop ML algorithms specifically designed for scientific discovery (e.g., materials science), rather than repurposing existing tools, has been explicitly highlighted.
   * Explainability, Interpretability, and Trustworthiness (XAI/UQ): For AI/ML systems to be deployed in safety-critical energy applications, such as reactor control, grid stability management, or component lifetime prediction, operators and regulators must be able to understand and trust their outputs. "Black box" models with opaque decision-making processes are generally unacceptable. Significant research gaps exist in developing robust explainable AI (XAI) methods that can provide clear rationale for AI predictions and decisions, along with rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ) to assess the confidence level in those outputs. Ensuring the overall safety, security, and trustworthiness of AI/ML systems in critical infrastructure is paramount.
   * Hybrid Modeling: Integrating AI/ML with Physics-Based Simulations: Combining the data-driven pattern recognition capabilities of AI/ML with the predictive power and physical grounding of traditional physics-based simulations offers a promising path to accelerate complex modeling tasks. AI/ML can be used, for example, as surrogate models to speed up computationally expensive simulations, to learn closure relations or parameters within physics models from data, or to fuse data from multiple sources (simulations and experiments). Research gaps exist in developing optimal frameworks for this integration, ensuring the resulting hybrid models maintain physical consistency and accuracy, and validating their performance against relevant benchmarks.
   * AI/ML for Real-Time Control and Optimization: Applying AI/ML for the real-time control of dynamic, complex energy systems—such as stabilizing fusion plasmas against instabilities, optimizing the operation of advanced reactors under varying loads, or managing power flow in grids with high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs)—requires algorithms that are not only fast and accurate but also robust to uncertainty, adaptable to changing conditions, and guaranteed to operate safely. Reinforcement learning is a potential candidate but requires significant development and validation for reliable deployment in these high-stakes control loops.
   * Accelerated Materials Discovery for Extreme Environments: While AI/ML is rapidly transforming materials discovery in general , specific challenges remain in applying these tools effectively to the search for materials capable of withstanding the coupled extreme environments (high temperature, intense radiation, corrosion) relevant to fusion and advanced fission reactors. Key gaps include developing models that can accurately predict material performance under these combined stressors, especially when experimental training data is scarce, and integrating AI/ML algorithms tightly with high-throughput computational simulations and automated experimental platforms designed for extreme conditions.
   * Cybersecurity of AI-Enabled Energy Systems: As AI/ML becomes more deeply embedded in the monitoring, control, and optimization of critical energy infrastructure, the cybersecurity of these AI systems themselves becomes a major concern. Adversarial attacks could potentially manipulate AI models or poison training data, leading to incorrect decisions, system instability, or physical damage. Research is needed to develop robust, secure, and resilient AI algorithms and architectures specifically designed for deployment in critical energy systems, along with methods for detecting and mitigating AI-specific cyber threats.
V. Synthesis and Strategic Recommendations: Prioritizing Under-Investigated Research
A. Convergent Insights from Institutional Reports and Funding Analyses
Analysis of recent reports and strategic documents from key institutions involved in energy R&D reveals several convergent themes regarding priorities and under-investigated areas:
 * DOE/FESAC Fusion Strategy: There is a clear strategic shift within DOE's Fusion Energy Sciences (FES), guided by the 2020 FESAC Long-Range Plan, towards accelerating the development of a commercially viable Fusion Pilot Plant (FPP), targeted for the 2040s. This involves increased emphasis on closing critical science and technology (S&T) gaps in areas beyond core plasma physics, specifically: fusion materials and technology (FM&T), including plasma-facing components (PFCs) and structural materials; tritium breeding blankets and fuel cycle closure; and harnessing fusion power. Concurrently, there is growing recognition of the need to support innovative and alternative fusion concepts (like stellarators) alongside the mainstream tokamak path (ITER) as potential routes to more attractive FPP designs. New public-private partnership models, like the Milestone Program and FIRE Collaboratives, are being implemented to bridge the gap between basic research and industry needs.
 * GAO Oversight and Planning Gaps: GAO reports consistently highlight the challenges posed by the "immature state" of fusion technology and the historical underfunding of commercialization-focused activities within FES. While acknowledging recent DOE strategic shifts, GAO emphasizes the critical need for finalized implementation plans with specific roles, responsibilities, risk mitigation strategies, metrics, and timelines to guide these efforts effectively. The potential misalignment between public sector basic science priorities and private sector commercialization goals is also noted as a persistent challenge requiring policy attention.
 * National Academies (NASEM) Perspectives: NASEM reports underscore the remaining significant technical challenges facing fusion energy  and highlight the growing complexity and need for enhanced resilience and reliability in the nation's electricity grid as it integrates more distributed and variable resources. They also emphasize the importance of evaluating the local community impacts of large energy projects funded by recent legislation  and advocate for sustained investment in fundamental research across scientific disciplines as the bedrock of future energy innovation.
 * ARPA-E's Role in Transformational R&D: ARPA-E is positioned to fund high-risk, potentially transformative energy technologies that fall outside the scope of traditional R&D programs or private investment. Its portfolio includes targeted programs aimed at specific "white spaces" or technological gaps across the energy landscape, including efforts relevant to fusion energy (e.g., BETHE, GAMOW focusing on enabling technologies ), advanced reactor operations (e.g., GEMINA using AI/digital twins ), grid modernization, energy storage, and novel concepts explored through initiatives like SEED. ARPA-E's model emphasizes bridging the gap from research to market.
 * EPRI's Industry Focus: Reports from EPRI reflect industry priorities, focusing on near-to-medium term challenges. Key areas include ensuring resource adequacy and grid reliability amidst increasing penetration of renewables and storage , enhancing grid resilience against cybersecurity threats and extreme weather events , managing the environmental impacts and costs of the clean energy transition , addressing gaps in battery energy storage deployment (safety, reliability, cost) , and resolving materials degradation issues (like environmentally assisted fatigue) in the existing nuclear fleet.
 * Energy Sciences Coalition (ESC) Advocacy: The ESC consistently advocates for robust and sustained funding for the DOE Office of Science, arguing that fundamental research across all scientific disciplines (physical sciences, materials, computing, biology, etc.) is essential for underpinning long-term energy innovation and U.S. competitiveness. They express concern over potential cuts to core research areas and emphasize the need for investment in world-class user facilities, multidisciplinary research centers, and workforce development programs to tackle grand challenges in areas including fusion, advanced nuclear, AI/ML, and quantum science.
 * Recurring Under-Investigation Themes: Synthesizing across these institutional perspectives, several recurring themes emerge regarding areas that are critical yet appear relatively under-investigated or under-resourced compared to their importance:
   * Enabling Technologies for Multiple Pathways: Foundational technologies like advanced materials capable of surviving coupled extreme environments, robust plasma diagnostics for burning plasmas, efficient direct energy conversion, validated multi-physics modeling & simulation tools, and qualified advanced manufacturing techniques are crucial enablers for a wide range of fusion and advanced fission concepts. Investment in these cross-cutting areas often lags behind investment in specific large-scale demonstration projects.
   * Alternative Concepts and Innovation: While large flagship projects (like ITER) dominate public funding, there is a growing consensus (reflected in DOE strategy shifts and private investment trends) on the need to explore and support alternative fusion concepts and innovative advanced fission designs that might offer faster or more economical pathways. Foundational R&D supporting these alternatives appears underdeveloped relative to their potential.
   * Validation and Integration Gaps: Moving from component-level research or conceptual design to integrated, reliable systems requires significant effort in validation and testing. Key gaps include the lack of facilities for testing materials under combined extreme conditions, the scarcity of experimental data for validating advanced simulation codes (especially for non-LWRs and burning plasmas), the need for integral testing of passive safety systems, and the challenge of demonstrating reliable integration of complex subsystems (e.g., fusion drivers with fission blankets, plasma exhaust with DEC).
   * Fuel Cycle Closure and Waste Management: For both fusion (tritium breeding) and advanced fission (reprocessing, P&T), closing the fuel cycle sustainably and managing long-lived waste remain critical long-term challenges requiring significant, sustained R&D investment beyond basic feasibility studies, particularly in demonstrating efficient, reliable, and economic processes at scale.
   * Bridging Basic Science to Commercialization: While fundamental science is crucial, translating discoveries into practical technologies requires focused efforts on engineering R&D, systems integration, establishing supply chains, developing regulatory frameworks, and fostering effective public-private partnerships – areas historically underemphasized in some public R&D programs but now receiving increased attention.

C. Concluding Remarks
The transition to a sustainable energy future demands innovation across a spectrum of advanced technologies, including nuclear fusion, advanced fission, and novel concepts like EGS or potentially SBSP. While significant progress has been made along mainstream research pathways, achieving commercially viable and widely deployable solutions requires addressing critical gaps that often lie in less-explored or under-funded areas. This report, synthesizing findings from numerous technical and strategic assessments, has identified several high-priority research frontiers where targeted investment could yield substantial returns.
These under-investigated areas frequently involve enabling technologies crucial for multiple advanced energy systems (e.g., materials for combined extremes, advanced manufacturing qualification, specialized AI/ML), specific challenges within alternative concepts that might offer advantages over mainstream approaches (e.g., alternative fusion confinement, P&T for waste management, EGS reservoir engineering), or critical validation and integration steps needed to bridge the gap from scientific feasibility to engineering reality (e.g., burning plasma diagnostics, passive safety validation, DEC integration). Addressing these gaps requires a strategic R&D approach that balances support for large-scale demonstrations with focused investment in foundational science and enabling technologies, fosters collaboration between public research institutions and the growing private sector, and ensures the development of robust planning with clear goals, metrics, and sustained funding commitments. Prioritizing these identified under-investigated research areas offers a pathway to accelerate progress, mitigate risks, and ultimately realize the potential of advanced energy systems to meet future global energy needs cleanly and reliably.
