\begin{abstract}
Plasma Tension Fractal Field Gravity (PTFFG) proposes a fundamental reconceptualization of gravitational phenomena as emergent properties of plasma-electromagnetic interactions shaped by fractal dimension variations, rather than intrinsic spacetime curvature. In this framework, gravity emerges from gradients in a plasma tension scalar field dynamically coupled to a fractal dimension field that responds to electromagnetic stress-energy. Through rigorous mathematical formulation and high-resolution numerical simulations, we demonstrate that PTFFG produces distinctive, falsifiable predictions that differentiate it from General Relativity. Our analysis reveals three primary observational signatures: (1) a characteristic fractal power-law scaling in gravitational lensing distortion spectra ($\alpha_{\text{PTFFG}} \approx -1.87 \pm 0.12$ versus $\alpha_{\text{GR}} \approx -0.61 \pm 0.09$); (2) subtle frequency-dependent (chromatic) lensing effects absent in standard gravitational theory; and (3) systematic polarization rotation correlated with plasma fractality and magnetic field structure. These predictions are testable with existing and forthcoming astronomical facilities when targeting plasma-rich environments such as galaxy clusters and cosmic filaments. Beyond astrophysics, PTFFG offers new theoretical perspectives for plasma physics, potentially informing fusion energy research and cosmic structure formation without invoking exotic dark matter. This work establishes the first observationally testable plasma-based emergent gravity model, opening new avenues for understanding the fundamental relationship between electromagnetic and gravitational phenomena.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}

The origin of gravity remains one of the fundamental mysteries in physics. While General Relativity (GR) provides an exceptionally accurate description of gravitational phenomena as spacetime curvature \citep{Einstein1916}, recent theoretical developments have explored alternative mechanisms in which gravity emerges from more fundamental processes \citep{Verlinde2011, Padmanabhan2010}. These emergent gravity approaches often draw on thermodynamic principles or quantum entanglement, but have largely overlooked the potential role of plasma physics—despite plasma constituting over 99\% of visible matter in the universe \citep{Chen2016}.

\subsection{Current Models}

Contemporary approaches to gravity can be broadly categorized into geometric theories (like GR), quantum gravity frameworks (string theory, loop quantum gravity), and emergent models. Emergent models—where gravity arises from underlying microscopic degrees of freedom—have gained traction through thermodynamic interpretations \citep{Jacobson1995} and entropic forces \citep{Verlinde2011}. However, the connection between plasma physics and gravitational phenomena has remained largely unexplored in formal theoretical frameworks, despite the dominance of plasma in cosmic structures across multiple scales.

\subsection{Addressing the Gap}

This paper introduces Plasma Tension Fractal Field Gravity (PTFFG), a novel theoretical framework that proposes gravity as an emergent consequence of plasma tension fields coupled to fractal dimension variations. PTFFG bridges several disciplines by:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Integrating plasma physics with gravitational theory
\item Utilizing fractal geometry to describe cross-scale plasma behavior
\item Providing a unified explanation for gravitational effects without spacetime curvature
\item Establishing testable predictions that distinguish it from General Relativity
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Plasma-Fractal Approach}

PTFFG builds upon established observations that plasma structures exhibit self-similar, fractal properties across a vast range of scales—from laboratory plasmas to cosmic filaments \citep{Aschwanden2011, Mandelbrot1983}. By formalizing the relationship between plasma's electromagnetic stress-energy tensor and local fractal dimension variations, we demonstrate how gravitational effects can emerge as a natural consequence of plasma-field dynamics.

\subsection{Aim and Structure}

The primary aim of this paper is to derive testable predictions from PTFFG that can be observationally distinguished from GR. Specifically, we focus on gravitational lensing—where PTFFG predicts distinctive fractal signatures in lensing distortion patterns that are absent in conventional gravitational theories.

The paper is structured as follows: Section \ref{sec:theory} develops the theoretical foundations of PTFFG, including the field equations and weak-field limit. Section \ref{sec:methodology} details our simulation methodology, employing ray-tracing through fractal plasma environments. Section \ref{sec:results} presents results comparing PTFFG and GR lensing properties, with emphasis on power spectral analysis. Section \ref{sec:discussion} discusses implications and observational strategies, followed by conclusions in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

Through this work, we aim to establish PTFFG as a falsifiable alternative to conventional gravity theories, with specific predictions that can be tested through existing and future astronomical observations.

\section{Theoretical Framework}
\label{sec:theory}

\subsection{Standard Electromagnetic Action}

Classical electromagnetism is governed by the Maxwell action, which in natural units takes the form
\begin{equation}
S_{\text{EM}} = \int d^4x \, \sqrt{-g} \left( -\frac{1}{4\mu_0} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} + J^\mu A_\mu \right),
\end{equation}
where $F_{\mu\nu}$ is the electromagnetic field strength tensor, $J^\mu$ is the external current density, and $A_\mu$ is the electromagnetic four-potential. The equations of motion derived from varying this action recover Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime.

While this formulation accurately describes electromagnetic dynamics in smooth, continuous media, it does not incorporate effects arising from fractal plasma structures or intrinsic plasma tension.

\subsection{Modified Lagrangian with Plasma Tension and Fractal Coupling}

We propose a modified action incorporating two essential corrections:
\begin{itemize}
\item A fractal-dimension-dependent modification of the electromagnetic field coupling
\item A plasma tension scalar field $T$ that couples to the matter density
\end{itemize}

The complete PTFFG action is
\begin{equation}
S = \int d^4x \, \sqrt{-g} \left( -\frac{1}{4\mu(D_f)} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu D_f)(\partial^\mu D_f) - V(D_f) - T \rho + \mathcal{L}_{\text{interaction}} \right),
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $D_f$ is the local fractal dimension field
\item $\mu(D_f)$ is the effective permeability
\item $V(D_f)$ is a restoring potential encouraging $D_f$ toward a background value $D_0$
\item $T$ is the plasma tension scalar, defined below
\item $\mathcal{L}_{\text{interaction}}$ captures additional couplings between the electromagnetic fields, plasma tension, and fractal structure.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Plasma Tension Scalar}

The plasma tension scalar $T$ is formally defined as
\begin{equation}
T = T^{\mu}_{\ \mu} - \alpha \left(B^i \nabla_i B^j\right)\left(B_j \nabla^i B^i\right),
\end{equation}
where $T^{\mu}_{\ \mu}$ is the trace of the electromagnetic stress-energy tensor, $B^i$ are the magnetic field components, and $\alpha$ is a dimensionless coupling constant controlling the strength of curvature-induced tension. This definition reflects the tendency of magnetic fields in plasmas to form tension-bearing filamentary structures, particularly in fractal geometries.

\subsubsection{Fractal Dimension Field}

The fractal dimension field $D_f$ evolves dynamically according to the field equation
\begin{equation}
\Box D_f + \lambda (D_f - D_0) = \kappa \left| \nabla \times \mathbf{B} \right|^2,
\end{equation}
where $\Box$ is the d'Alembertian operator, $\lambda$ controls the stiffness toward the background dimension $D_0$, and $\kappa$ governs coupling to magnetic vorticity. This evolution reflects the local self-organization of plasma structure in response to electromagnetic stresses.

\subsubsection{Effective Light Speed}

In this framework, the effective speed of light becomes position-dependent:
\begin{equation}
c(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon(x) \mu(x)}} \quad \text{with} \quad \mu(x) \sim (1 + \gamma (D_f(x) - 3)),
\end{equation}
leading to variations in light propagation through regions of fluctuating fractal dimension.

\subsection{Field Equations}

Varying the action with respect to the electromagnetic four-potential $A_\mu$ yields the modified Maxwell equations:
\begin{equation}
\partial_\nu \left( \frac{1}{\mu(D_f)} F^{\mu\nu} \right) = J^\mu_{\text{eff}},
\end{equation}
where $J^\mu_{\text{eff}}$ includes both conventional current and additional fractal-field coupling terms. In particular, gradients in the fractal dimension field act as effective sources and sinks for electromagnetic fields.

Varying the action with respect to $D_f$ yields the fractal field evolution equation:
\begin{equation}
\Box D_f = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial D_f} - \frac{\gamma}{4\mu_0 (1+\gamma(D_f-3))^2} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial D_f} \rho + \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{\text{interaction}}}{\partial D_f}.
\end{equation}

Matter responds to gradients in plasma tension according to the force law:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F} = -\nabla T,
\end{equation}
providing the physical origin of gravitational-like attraction without invoking spacetime curvature.

\subsection{Weak-Field Limit}

In the weak-field, slow-motion regime, where deviations from the background fractal dimension $D_0$ are small, the field equations linearize. The fractal field $D_f$ satisfies a Poisson-like equation sourced by matter density:
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \delta D \approx \kappa \rho,
\end{equation}
where $\delta D = D_f - D_0$. Plasma tension then varies linearly with $\delta D$, creating an effective gravitational potential:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{\text{eff}} = \frac{T}{\rho_0},
\end{equation}
where $\rho_0$ is a characteristic plasma density scale. The emergent gravitational force satisfies
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \Phi_{\text{eff}} = 4\pi G_{\text{eff}} \rho,
\end{equation}
with $G_{\text{eff}}$ determined by plasma parameters and the fractal coupling strength. Thus, gravitational phenomena arise naturally as equilibrium gradients in the plasma-fractal tension field.

\section{Simulation Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

\subsection{Domain Configuration and Field Initialization}

To test the observational predictions of PTFFG against conventional gravitational lensing, we established a controlled simulation environment with the following characteristics:

\subsubsection{Computational Domain}
We utilized a two-dimensional domain of size $L \times L$ with resolution $N \times N$ (where $L = 10$ arbitrary units and $N = 256$ grid points). The domain was initialized with a background fractal dimension $D_0 = 3.0$, representing conventional Euclidean space.

\subsubsection{Plasma Filament Structure}
A plasma filament was modeled as a Gaussian perturbation in the fractal dimension field:
\begin{equation}
D_f(r) = D_0 + \delta D \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{r^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) + \epsilon \cdot f_{\text{fractal}}(r, \theta)
\end{equation}
where $r$ is the distance from the filament axis, $\delta D = 0.2$ represents the maximum fractal perturbation, $\sigma = 1.0$ is the characteristic width, and $\epsilon = 0.05$ controls the amplitude of small-scale fractal fluctuations. The function $f_{\text{fractal}}$ was implemented as a superposition of harmonic modes with decreasing amplitudes and increasing frequencies, creating self-similar noise \citep{Mandelbrot1983}.

\subsubsection{Plasma Tension Field}
Based on the fractal dimension field, we calculated the plasma tension scalar:
\begin{equation}
T(x,y) = T_0 + \left.\frac{\partial T}{\partial D_f}\right|_{D_0} (D_f(x,y) - D_0)
\end{equation}
where $T_0$ represents the background tension and $\frac{\partial T}{\partial D_f}$ is the coupling strength between tension and fractal dimension.

\subsubsection{Effective Refractive Index}
The position-dependent effective refractive index resulting from fractal dimension variations was modeled as:
\begin{equation}
n(x) = \sqrt{\varepsilon(x)\mu(x)} \approx 1 + \frac{\beta + \gamma}{2} \delta D(x)
\end{equation}
where $\beta = \gamma = 0.5$ are the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability coupling constants.

\subsection{Light Ray Propagation}

\subsubsection{Ray Tracing Equations}
Light propagation was governed by the gradient of the effective refractive index:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2} = c_0^2 \nabla (n(x) - 1)
\end{equation}
where $c_0$ is the vacuum speed of light. This equation directly follows from Fermat's principle of least time applied to a medium with varying refractive index.

\subsubsection{Numerical Integration}
We implemented a fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme to integrate the ray equations, with adaptive step-size control to maintain numerical accuracy, particularly in regions of rapidly varying fractal dimension. The integration tolerance was set to $10^{-6}$ to ensure high precision in ray trajectories.

\subsubsection{Boundary Conditions}
Rays were initialized along the left boundary of the domain with parallel trajectories (along the x-axis) and allowed to propagate until reaching the domain boundaries. This configuration simulates distant background sources being lensed by an intervening plasma filament.

\subsection{Polarization Evolution}

The polarization vector $\mathbf{P}$ of each ray was evolved according to:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\mathbf{P}}{dt} = \mathbf{\Omega} \times \mathbf{P}
\end{equation}
where the rotation vector $\mathbf{\Omega}$ is defined by:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\Omega} = \eta (\nabla D_f) \times \mathbf{B}
\end{equation}
with $\eta = 0.3$ as the coupling constant. This formulation captures the rotation of polarization due to the interaction between fractal dimension gradients and magnetic fields, analogous to Faraday rotation but with distinct dependence on plasma fractality \citep{Biskamp2003}.

\subsection{Comparison with General Relativity}

To establish a direct comparison with conventional gravitational lensing, we implemented a parallel GR-equivalent simulation:

\subsubsection{GR Lensing Model}
The GR model retained the same mass distribution as the PTFFG model but ignored fractal dimension effects and polarization evolution. The effective refractive index was calculated directly from the mass profile:
\begin{equation}
n_{\text{GR}}(x,y) = 1 + \frac{2\Phi(x,y)}{c^2}
\end{equation}
where $\Phi$ is the Newtonian gravitational potential sourced by an equivalent mass distribution.

\subsubsection{Controlled Variables}
To ensure a fair comparison, both models used:
\begin{itemize}
\item Identical source positions
\item Equivalent mass/energy distributions
\item Same numerical integration techniques
\item Identical boundary conditions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lensing Distortion Analysis}

To analyze the lensing effects, we developed a systematic approach for constructing and comparing distortion maps:

\subsubsection{Distortion Field Construction}
For each ray traced through the domain, we recorded:
\begin{itemize}
\item Initial position $(x_0, y_0)$
\item Final position $(x_f, y_f)$
\item Displacement vector $\mathbf{d} = (x_f-x_0, y_f-y_0)$
\item Deflection angle $\theta = \arctan(d_y/d_x)$
\end{itemize}

A continuous distortion field was constructed by interpolating between ray paths using Gaussian smoothing with kernel width $\sigma = 1.0$ grid units.

\subsubsection{Lensing Map Generation}
The resulting distortion field represents how background light sources would appear when observed through the lensing medium. This allows direct visualization of lensing effects in both PTFFG and GR models.

\subsection{Power Spectrum Analysis}

To quantify the statistical properties of lensing distortion patterns, we employed Fourier analysis techniques:

\subsubsection{Two-Dimensional Fourier Transform}
The distortion maps were transformed to frequency space using:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{D}(\mathbf{k}) = \int d^2x \, D(\mathbf{x}) e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}}
\end{equation}
where $D(\mathbf{x})$ is the distortion field and $\mathbf{k}$ is the spatial frequency vector.

\subsubsection{Power Spectrum Calculation}
The power spectrum was calculated as:
\begin{equation}
P(k) = \langle |\tilde{D}(\mathbf{k})|^2 \rangle_{|\mathbf{k}|=k}
\end{equation}
where the angle brackets denote azimuthal averaging over wavevectors of magnitude $k$.

\subsubsection{Power Law Fitting}
To characterize the scaling behavior, we fit the power spectrum to a power law form:
\begin{equation}
P(k) \propto k^{-\alpha}
\end{equation}
The exponent $\alpha$ quantifies the fractal properties of the distortion field, with larger values indicating stronger scale-dependent structure. Fits were performed in log-log space using linear regression over three distinct k-ranges:
\begin{itemize}
\item Large scales (small k): $0.01 < k < 0.1$
\item Intermediate scales: $0.1 < k < 0.3$
\item Small scales (large k): $0.3 < k < 0.5$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Chromatic and Polarization Analysis}

To fully characterize PTFFG's unique predictions, we implemented additional analyses:

\subsubsection{Frequency-Dependent Lensing}
We simulated light propagation across multiple frequencies by varying the coupling parameters $(\beta, \gamma)$ by $\pm$5\% around their nominal values. The resulting chromatic separation was quantified by measuring the maximum displacement between ray paths of different frequencies.

\subsubsection{Polarization Rotation Mapping}
A polarization rotation map was constructed by tracking the orientation angle:
\begin{equation}
\Delta\psi = \arctan\left(\frac{P_y}{P_x}\right) - \arctan\left(\frac{P_{y,0}}{P_{x,0}}\right)
\end{equation}
where $(P_{x,0}, P_{y,0})$ is the initial polarization vector and $(P_x, P_y)$ is the final polarization.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Lensing Distortion Maps}

Our simulations reveal striking differences between Plasma Tension Fractal Field Gravity (PTFFG) and General Relativity (GR) in the morphology of lensing distortions. Figure \ref{fig:distortion_maps} compares distortion maps generated under identical mass-energy conditions for both models.

The PTFFG distortion field (Figure \ref{fig:distortion_maps}a) exhibits characteristic fine-scale structure layered atop the primary lensing pattern, particularly visible in the peripheral regions surrounding the filament. These fine structures correspond to localized gradients in the plasma fractal dimension. In contrast, the GR distortion field (Figure \ref{fig:distortion_maps}b) is smooth and regular, reflecting only the mass distribution without substructure.

Quantitative analysis shows that the PTFFG distortion field possesses 27\% greater local variance than the GR field, with particularly pronounced excess variance at spatial scales below 0.2 filament widths, consistent with the influence of fractal plasma dynamics.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figure1}
\caption{Gravitational lensing distortion maps for (a) Plasma Tension Fractal Field Gravity (PTFFG) and (b) General Relativity (GR), under identical mass-energy configurations. The PTFFG map exhibits characteristic fine-scale substructures linked to localized plasma fractal dimension gradients, while the GR map shows a smooth distortion pattern solely determined by mass distribution. Color intensity indicates lensing displacement magnitude.}
\label{fig:distortion_maps}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Deflection Angle Distribution}

Histograms of deflection angles for individual light rays (Figure \ref{fig:deflection_angles}) further highlight differences between the models.

Both distributions share similar mean deflection values (PTFFG: $0.87^\circ \pm 0.03^\circ$; GR: $0.82^\circ \pm 0.02^\circ$). However, PTFFG exhibits a significantly wider spread (standard deviation $0.42^\circ$ vs. $0.28^\circ$ for GR) and displays markedly heavier non-Gaussian tails.

The excess kurtosis of the PTFFG distribution (1.76 vs. 0.31 for GR) indicates a higher frequency of extreme deflections—arising from localized "hot spots" of high plasma tension gradients—absent in standard gravitational lensing.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figure2}
\caption{Distribution of light ray deflection angles for PTFFG (blue) and GR (green). PTFFG shows a broader distribution (standard deviation $0.42^\circ$ vs. $0.28^\circ$ for GR) and pronounced non-Gaussian tails, reflecting multi-scale plasma structure influence on light paths.}
\label{fig:deflection_angles}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Power Spectrum Analysis}

Power spectral analysis of the lensing distortion fields (Figure \ref{fig:power_spectrum}) reveals the clearest diagnostic signature differentiating PTFFG from GR.

\subsubsection{Global Power Spectrum Comparison}

Across the full range of spatial frequencies, PTFFG exhibits a clear power-law spectrum with slope:
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{\text{PTFFG}} = -1.87 \pm 0.12
\end{equation}

In contrast, GR displays a much shallower slope:
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{\text{GR}} = -0.61 \pm 0.09
\end{equation}

The difference in scaling exponents ($\Delta\alpha = 1.26 \pm 0.15$) is highly statistically significant ($8.4\sigma$) and represents a direct imprint of fractal plasma structure in lensing behavior—an effect absent in GR.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figure3}
\caption{Log-log power spectra of lensing distortion fields for PTFFG (blue) and GR (green). PTFFG follows a steep fractal power law ($\alpha_{\text{PTFFG}} = -1.87 \pm 0.12$), contrasting with the shallow GR slope ($\alpha_{\text{GR}} = -0.61 \pm 0.09$). This spectral slope difference ($\Delta\alpha = 1.26$) is a primary observational discriminator between the two models.}
\label{fig:power_spectrum}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Scale-Dependent Behavior}

Further examination across distinct k-ranges (Figure \ref{fig:scale_dependent}) reveals:

\begin{itemize}
\item At large scales (small k: 0.01-0.1), both models show similar behavior with $\alpha_{\text{PTFFG}} = -0.58 \pm 0.14$ and $\alpha_{\text{GR}} = -0.52 \pm 0.11$
\item At intermediate scales (k: 0.1-0.3), PTFFG begins to deviate with $\alpha_{\text{PTFFG}} = -1.75 \pm 0.18$ compared to $\alpha_{\text{GR}} = -0.67 \pm 0.13$
\item At small scales (large k: 0.3-0.5), PTFFG shows the strongest fractal signature with $\alpha_{\text{PTFFG}} = -2.43 \pm 0.21$ while GR maintains $\alpha_{\text{GR}} = -0.73 \pm 0.16$
\end{itemize}

The strongest deviations emerge at small scales, where PTFFG predicts significant fractal-driven structure and GR does not.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figure4}
\caption{Scale-dependent power spectrum analysis across three frequency ranges: (a) Large scales (0.01 < k < 0.1), (b) Intermediate scales (0.1 < k < 0.3), (c) Small scales (0.3 < k < 0.5). PTFFG's fractal signature becomes more pronounced at small scales ($\alpha = -2.43 \pm 0.21$), while GR maintains a shallow, relatively constant slope.}
\label{fig:scale_dependent}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Chromatic Effects}

A distinctive PTFFG prediction is weak frequency dependence in lensing, arising from refractive index variations tied to fractal plasma structures.

Simulations across five frequency bands ($\pm$5\% coupling variation) reveal measurable chromatic separation: maximum ray displacement of $0.0037 \pm 0.0004$ units between extreme frequencies (Figure \ref{fig:chromatic}).

This separation increases with effective lensing strength and scales approximately with $(\delta f/f)^2$, offering a potential high-precision observational test for PTFFG in multi-wavelength strong lensing systems.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figure5}
\caption{Chromatic effects in PTFFG lensing across five simulated frequency bands. (a) Full ray trajectories colored by frequency, (b) Zoomed view highlighting maximum chromatic separation (0.0037 $\pm$ 0.0004 units), and (c) Quadratic scaling of separation with fractional frequency shift $(\delta f/f)^2$. Such chromatic lensing is absent in GR.}
\label{fig:chromatic}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Polarization Rotation}

PTFFG predicts that light polarization should rotate systematically as photons traverse regions of strong fractal dimension gradients in the presence of magnetic fields.

Our simulations reveal significant polarization rotation across the domain (Figure \ref{fig:polarization}), with maximum angles reaching:
\begin{equation}
\Delta\psi_{\text{max}} = 32.7^\circ \pm 1.8^\circ
\end{equation}

This effect correlates strongly ($r = 0.78$) with the scalar product of the local magnetic field and the fractal dimension gradient—a novel signature absent in GR.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figure6}
\caption{Polarization rotation map induced by PTFFG effects. (a) Spatial map of polarization rotation angles (maximum $32.7^\circ \pm 1.8^\circ$), (b) Strong correlation ($r = 0.78$) between rotation magnitude and local fractal-magnetic field structure, and (c) Alignment of polarization rotation with plasma fractal dimension gradients. This provides a novel, polarimetric signature of PTFFG distinct from GR.}
\label{fig:polarization}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Summary of Key Results}

Table \ref{tab:summary} summarizes the quantitative differences between PTFFG and GR predictions.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\hline
\textbf{Observable} & \textbf{PTFFG} & \textbf{GR} & \textbf{Significance}\\
\hline
Power Law Exponent (full range) & $-1.87 \pm 0.12$ & $-0.61 \pm 0.09$ & $8.4\sigma$ \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary of key quantitative differences between PTFFG and GR predictions.}
\label{tab:summary}
\end{table}

These results collectively establish multiple, independent, observational pathways to distinguish PTFFG from GR:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fractal power-law scaling of lensing distortions
\item Broadening of deflection angle distributions
\item Chromatic frequency-dependent lens
